        <h2>Our approach to investment and the power of process</h2>
        <ul class="services-item-list">
            <li>We believe investment processes are key to long-term performance and effective risk control. Our fund managers are truly active in applying their investment processes.</li>
            <li>There is no house view - our fund managers have the freedom to manage their portfolios according to their own investment processes and market views without being distracted by other day-to-day aspects of running a fund management company.</li>
            <li>Staying true to their documented investment processes helps to create an in-built risk control for our fund managers, especially in more challenging environments, by preventing them from investing in companies and funds for the wrong reasons.</li>
            <li>Documenting an investment process means you, as an investor in our funds and portfolios, know exactly how each team manages your money.</li>
            <li>The fund managers invest in funds they run, which shows a belief in and a commitment to their investment processes and fellow investors.</li>
            <li>Liontrust ensures that appropriate and prudent levels of risk are taken to meet the investment objectives and policies of all our funds.</li>
            <li>In general, risk within a fund is controlled and monitored in two ways: the investment process and predetermined risk controls.</li>
        </ul>

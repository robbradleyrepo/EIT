        There are many measures that 10ticks uses for mental arithmetic and improvements in Liontrust pupils.
        <br />
        <br />
        The speed evaluation is based on the Beat the Clock game. How many questions can you answer correctly in 60 seconds? The game takes a baseline test, then an ongoing average is kept for each pupil. The percentage improvement is based on the baseline test to ongoing average score. This improvement is mapped against the number of times pupils log in to the system. Liontrust pupils who log in to the system twice a week improve their speed by more than 40%.

        We have committed to integrating sustainability appropriately throughout the business. This includes publishing our Responsible Investment policy, which can be found on this page and provides details of our engagement-led approach and how we manage our stewardship at both the company level and for individual investment teams.
        
        
        Liontrust has made significant progress in the sustainability of our business and in the Sustainability Report 2021, which can also be found on this page, we outline the successes, where we need to do more and our priorities for the year ahead. Through the headings above, you can read our approach and commitment to being a responsible investor; climate change and the environment; people, diversity and inclusion; human rights; and being a good corporate citizen. 
        
        You can also find our policies in each of these sections, including the PRI Assessment Reports, voting records and the ESG commitments that Liontrust has signed up to.

        <br />
        <strong>Liontrust partners with Newcastle United Foundation (NUF) to provide a numeracy programme, Financial Football. This is designed to give primary school children a head start in financial education.
        <br />
        </strong>
        <br />
        The six-week programme has helped to break down any barriers that children face in understanding and learning about numeracy and finance, with the aim of improving children&rsquo;s understanding of money, as well as giving them the confidence to thrive in school maths lessons.
        <br />
        <br />
        Financial Football uses the popularity and profile of Newcastle United football club to encourage primary school pupils to engage with maths problems, using real life scenarios such as buying and selling football players and paying fines for red cards to teach concepts such as budgeting.

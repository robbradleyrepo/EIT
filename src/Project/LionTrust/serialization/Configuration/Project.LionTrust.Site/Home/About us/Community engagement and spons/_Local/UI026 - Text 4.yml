        <strong>Liontrust are proud sponsors of the global conservation charity ZSL and their efforts to protect the Asiatic lion from extinction, a partnership that stretches back nearly a decade.&nbsp;</strong><br />
        <br />
        Liontrust has helped recently to bring together a newly matched pair of the big cats at ZSL London Zoo’s immersive Land of the Lions exhibit. It is hoped that the pair will breed and boost the numbers of the Critically Endangered species – of which just 600 remain in the wild.<br />
        <br />
        The iconic big cats which once roamed across Asia – from Turkey to Eastern India – are now found only in the Gir Forest in Gujarat, India. Thanks to conservation efforts, Asiatic lions were bought back from the brink of extinction and their numbers have risen slightly in the last decade, but their future is still precarious. Due to their limited range and reliance on a single habitat, Asiatic lions are particularly susceptible to disease outbreak or natural disaster.<br />

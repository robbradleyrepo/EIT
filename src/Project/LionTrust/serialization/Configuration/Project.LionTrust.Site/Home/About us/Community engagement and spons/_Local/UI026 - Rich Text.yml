        <strong>Liontrust has partnered with the Purpose Coalition on a Levelling Up Impact report which will set out its contribution to the levelling up agenda in the UK.</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Levelling Up Impact report will highlight the work Liontrust is already undertaking to deliver a positive impact on wider society, particularly through financial education and sustainability within the framework of 14 Levelling Up Goals.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Goals, established in 2021 by former Education Secretary Rt Hon Justine Greening with input from businesses, universities and policymakers, are designed to provide an architecture that will help tackle the challenges the country faces post Covid-19. They focus on key life stages - from early years through to adulthood, alongside other barriers such as fair career progression and closing the digital divide - and highlight the main issues that need to be resolved to create a level playing field for everyone.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Goals are the first major piece of work by the Purpose Coalition, which includes businesses, universities and public sector.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are delighted to be supporting Levelling up Goals because of the importance of providing opportunities to as many people as possible wherever they grow up and live.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the best ways of achieving this is through education. Helping children with numeracy and delivering financial education is very important to Liontrust because these are indispensable skills for everyday life. Research into financial literacy has shown a large number of young people in the UK do not feel confident about handling money and it is key to help children before they reach the age of 18.

        There is a responsibility to enable as many people as possible to boost their savings and future prosperity by making investments as simple to understand and as easy to access as possible. This is to democratise savings and investments.
        <br />
        <br />
        A way of encouraging people to engage with their savings to make them work more effectively is through sustainable investment. Most people can relate to the importance and benefit of sustainable investing for themselves and their world.

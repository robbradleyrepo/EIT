        <span style="color: #000000;">ZSL, through its science and conservation efforts in the field and at ZSL London Zoo, is working to ensure a future for Asiatic lions.</span><br /><br style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" />
        <span style="color: #000000;">Five protected areas currently exist to protect the Asiatic lion in India: the Gir Sanctuary, Gir National Park and Pania Sanctuary form the Gir Conservation Area (GCA) covering an area of 20,000 km2 of forest representing the core habitat for the Asiatic lion. The other two wildlife sanctuaries, Mitiyala and Girnar, protect satellite areas within a lion’s range distance of the Gir Conservation Area.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" />
        <span style="color: #000000;">ZSL supports all efforts to protect Asiatic lions in the Gir and works with the Wildlife Institute of India to assist with conservation efforts – from sharing expertise to providing training for wildlife vets.&nbsp; </span><br /><br style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" />
        <span style="color: #000000;">ZSL London Zoo’s flagship exhibit <em>Land of the Lions</em> is an immersive and engaging hub for ZSL’s Asiatic lion conservation and education efforts, and an area sponsored by Liontrust. Transporting visitors from the heart of London to India’s vibrant Sasan Gir, people can get closer than ever before to the lions, while embarking on an adventure through the Indian-inspired experience. From exploring an Indian barber shop, in the replica Sasan Gir high-street to a train-station, the exhibit truly gives visitors a sense of just how close lions and people live in India.&nbsp; </span><br /><br style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" />
        <span style="color: #000000;"><em>Land of the Lions</em> is home to a pair of Asiatic lions, male Bhanu and female Arya. Matched as part of the international breeding programme for endangered species, co-ordinated by EAZA’s (European Association of Zoos and Aquaria) big cat specialists, the hope is that the two will breed in future. </span><br /><br style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" />
        <span style="color: #000000;">Arya’s move from Paignton Zoo could not happen until the three females that previously resided at London had moved to a new home in Germany. Liontrust sponsored the moves of all four lions, including the creation of custom-made travel crates so that the precious cargo could travel in utmost comfort.</span><br /><br style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" />
        <span style="color: #000000;">The lions form a back-up population of the Critically Endangered species in an environment in which people are inspired to protect animals and where conservationists can learn both from and about animals. These learnings are shared with other zoos across the world and with conservationists in the field, who use this critical information to carry out their work in the wild.&nbsp;</span><br />

        <h3><span class="text-black">Tusk Lion Trail</span></h3>
        <br />
        Liontrust is proud to have supported the Tusk Lion Trail 2021 by sponsoring the lion statue that lived outside the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square. The event was part of a global celebration of lions, the people who live alongside them and the conservation work in Africa. Forty seven life-sized lion sculptures, designed and made by artists, musicians and sportspeople, were placed around the world, including in London, as part of the Trail.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are honoured that the Liontrust lion that lived in Trafalgar Square was been painted by the legendary comedian John Cleese and his wife Jen Wade. The rainbow colours signify hope, dreams and magic. The fish is the symbol of John Cleese’s wife.
        <br />

        Watch legendary John Cleese and Jen Wade chat about the inspiration behind their painting of the Liontrust lion in Trafalgar Square for Tusk. Lion conservation is vital and a long-term cause for Liontrust, and we're proud to support Tusk's Lion Trail in 2021

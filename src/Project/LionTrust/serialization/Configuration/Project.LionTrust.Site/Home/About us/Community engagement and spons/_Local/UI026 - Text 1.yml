        By February 2020, the project, which involves interactive games around football, had worked with 14 schools and 700 pupils. From September 2020, we expanded Financial Football to include Year 4 pupils as well as Year 5 and 6 and more schools so we could reach more primary school children &ndash; 500 a year &ndash; and introduced a new maths education programme to increase primary school children&rsquo;s confidence and understanding of this subject. Newcastle United Foundation enabled Financial Football to go online in case tighter lockdown restrictions limited external visitors to schools

            <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #414855;" class="text-black">67% in numeracy</span></li>
            <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #414855;" class="text-black"> 64% in addition, subtraction, multiplication</span></li>
            <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #414855;" class="text-black">75% in statistics</span></li>
            <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #414855;" class="text-black">84% in ratios</span></li>
        </ul>
        Phillip Cowler, Literacy and Numeracy Coordinator at Newcastle United Foundation, says: &ldquo;By using football as the basis for the maths challenges, we&rsquo;ve seen pupils who generally struggle to engage with numeracy feel more comfortable about getting involved due to their familiarity with Newcastle United.<br />

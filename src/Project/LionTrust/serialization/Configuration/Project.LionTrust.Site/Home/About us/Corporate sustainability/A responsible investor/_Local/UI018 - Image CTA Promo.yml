        <p><strong>We have committed to integrating sustainability appropriately throughout the business, which includes publishing our Responsible Investment policy. Each fund management team takes its own approach to integrating ESG factors into their investment process. Liontrust is a signatory to the PRI, a UN supported network of investors, which works to promote sustainable investment through the incorporation of environmental, social and Governance (ESG) factors into investment decision-making.<br />
        </strong></p>
        <p>We have been working to provide each team with the information and support to allow them to integrate ESG in the optimal way, ensuring their investment processes are enhanced and complemented by this work rather than imposing a centralised solution.</p>
        <p>We are committed to continue our work on achieving the following:</p>
        <ul class="services-item-list">
            <li>enhancing our ESG data and analytics for all our investment strategies</li>
            <li>training our staff</li>
            <li>investing in our company engagement capacity and resourcing</li>
            <li>disclosing how we integrate sustainability in each strategy and across the company</li>
            <li>increasing our reporting for funds on their ESG and climate characteristics</li>
            <li>improving our aggregated company reporting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why the Liontrust Sustainable Investment team</h2>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Experienced team</strong>: The 17-strong Sustainable Investment team has close to 200 years of combined experience. Peter Michaelis, Head of the team, has been managing sustainable global growth strategies since 2001. View the team page <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FC50869211184F83A77BBE54EA1A769A&amp;_z=z"><span class="text-primary">here</span></a>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Pioneers</strong>: Key members of the team were among the pioneers of sustainable investing, being founder members of the PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment) while at Aviva and leading on issues that are now central to mainstream investing such as not owning companies exposed to diesel engines, coal and oil (in 2001) and moving to exclude natural gas (from 2016).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Distinct, rigorous and repeatable process</strong>: The process seeks to generate strong returns from investing in companies aiming to deliver profits through positive social and environmental impacts. The managers look at the world through the prism of three mega trends – Better resource efficiency (cleaner), Improved health (healthier) and Greater safety and resilience (safer) – and then 21 themes within these.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Selecting stocks</strong>: The managers identify well-run companies whose products and operations benefit from these transformative changes and which are helping to make the world cleaner, healthier and safer. Further analysis hones this list down to those companies that exhibit superior sustainability management, will deliver persistently high returns on equity and are attractively valued on a five-year view.</p>
        <p><strong>Integrating ESG</strong>: Each manager is an analyst and is responsible for conducting research on a given sustainability theme and the sustainability analysis of potential investments. As each manager is also responsible for the business fundamentals and valuation analysis, we believe it derives an information advantage that would be lost if these roles were separate.&nbsp;</p>

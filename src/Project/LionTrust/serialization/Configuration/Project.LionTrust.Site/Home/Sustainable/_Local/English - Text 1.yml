        <div><strong>Time arbitrage</strong>: By having a longer time horizon than most, the managers can patiently invest in businesses they believe have years of growth ahead, and take advantage of dislocations in the market when these businesses are trading considerably below what the managers believe they are worth.&nbsp;<br /></div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>Engagement</strong>: This is an integral part of how the managers invest. Engaging on key ESG issues gives the managers greater insight, helps to identify leading companies and is used as a lever to encourage better business practices.&nbsp;</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>Impact</strong>: The managers show how their funds’ themes and investments are contributing to the UN’s SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). The managers have for many years published all holdings for them.&nbsp;</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>Mitigating CO2 exposure</strong>: Investments in the SF Managed Fund emit 77.0% less carbon (tCO2e) than the market it invests in as at 31 December 2022.

        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong>Advisory committee</strong>: The managers consult an external Advisory Committee, which comprises five experts in sustainability. The Committee’s role is to continually assess and challenge the team and offer guidance on evolving issues within sustainability.&nbsp;</div>

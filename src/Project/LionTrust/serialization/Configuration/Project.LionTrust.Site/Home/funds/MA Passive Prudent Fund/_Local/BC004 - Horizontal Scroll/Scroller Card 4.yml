      Hint: ScrollCard_Description
      Value: The fund managers want to ensure the underlying funds are exposed to the segment of the market they feel has the most potential for outperformance while reducing unintended risk. Therefore, they consider how each holding interacts with each other in terms of correlation, risk and return to ensure the benefits identified at the holding and sector levels are not diversified away when&nbsp;grouped together at the fund level.

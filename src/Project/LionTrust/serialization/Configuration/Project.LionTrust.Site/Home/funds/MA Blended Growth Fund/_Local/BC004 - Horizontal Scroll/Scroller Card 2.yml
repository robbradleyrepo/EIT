      Hint: ScrollCard_Description
      Value: "The primary aim of the tactical asset allocation (TAA) is to increase exposure to an asset class when it looks cheap and reduce exposure when it appears expensive; the fund managers&rsquo; focus is on valuations rather than market timing. They believe it is important to supplement the long-term benefits of the SAA with the flexibility to take advantage of valuation opportunities in the shorter term."

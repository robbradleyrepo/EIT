      Value: "Among the factors they analyse, the fund managers collate and study historical returns and volatilities of a range of asset classes, as well as their correlations with each other, and the pathway of future interest rates to determine the SAA that should meet the volatility target of the fund or&nbsp;portfolio over the long-term.&nbsp;The SAA is essentially the default asset allocation should the fund managers have no views about the relative attractiveness of different asset classes."

        <p>I believe in our investment process, even though we could have made a little more for our clients if we had reached down the quality spectrum, backing to a greater extent the measures in place to support credit markets. But then, what is it we are trying to achieve for our clients? My view of this is that we are trying to provide a good source of income and returns, in good times and bad, for the long-term. In this regard, I believe our process would have achieved this goal even if central bankers had not been standing behind us with a wind generator.</p>
        <p>As is typical of our Liontrust GF High Yield Bond Fund, going into 2021, we are light in CCCs and avoiding accumulations of thematic, commodity-like cyclicals. We are sanguine on the default risk within our Fund relative to a market that is being well supported by monetary institutions.</p>

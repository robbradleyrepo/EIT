        <h4><strong><span class="text-black">Invest via a financial adviser</span></strong></h4>
        <p>We always recommend you speak to a financial adviser if you need advice on making an investment. Advisers can help you plan your investments, and can invest in Liontrust funds on your behalf.</p>
        <p>You can find a financial adviser near you using <span class="text-primary"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.unbiased.co.uk/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">unbiased.co.uk</a></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4><strong><span class="text-black">Invest via a fund platform</span></strong></h4>
        <p>Fund platforms enable you to invest in Liontrust funds alongside those of other investment managers.<br />
        <br />
        Platforms are able to aggregate large numbers of clients, sometimes offering lower minimum investment amounts and lower fund charges as a result.<br />
        <br />
        The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theia.org/new-investing" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Investment Association’s website</a> contains more information about investing via fund platforms and can also help you find one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

      Value: "The portfolios are designed to target the outcome expected by investors in terms of their level of risk, as measured by volatility, and maximise the return for each fund within the appropriate risk band. These portfolios are for investors seeking a cost-effective investment solution that combines passive with good quality active investment managers in whom we invest to outperform the relevant indices over the medium to long term. The portfolios use passive funds where it is appropriate to do so and they are available and use actively managed funds where we believe the opportunity to deliver higher returns is greatest or where passive funds are not an option."

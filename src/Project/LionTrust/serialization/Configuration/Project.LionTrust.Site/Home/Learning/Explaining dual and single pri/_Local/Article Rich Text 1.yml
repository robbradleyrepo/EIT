        <p style="color: #222222; margin: 0px 0px 12px;"><strong>Dual priced funds</strong></p>
        <div class="rich-text cf" style="color: #222222;">
        <p style="margin: 0px 0px 14px;">Our range of UK-based unit trust funds are dual priced. This means our funds have an offer (or buying) price and a bid (or selling) price and the difference between these is known as the bid-offer spread.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0px 0px 14px;"><span>When pricing one of our unit trust funds, the pricing agent begins by calculating the creation price, which is the basic cost of creating a new unit and includes the price of buying underlying holdings and dealing costs such as stockbroking commission and stamp duty. To calculate the offer price, the pricing agent adds any applicable initial charge to the creation price. It follows, therefore, that any party purchasing units is compensating existing investors for any dilution in the fund&rsquo;s value caused by underlying fund transaction costs that may result from their unit purchase.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0px 0px 14px;"><span>The bid price at which units may be redeemed by investors is made up of the price that would be received when redeeming the underlying holdings less dealing costs such as stockbroking commission and stamp duty. It follows again, therefore, that any party selling units is compensating existing investors for any dilution in the fund&rsquo;s value caused by underlying transaction costs that may result from their unit redemption.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0px;"><span>The spread between a dual priced unit trust fund&rsquo;s bid and creation price will be dependent on the profile of the underlying portfolio of holdings. Funds transacting predominantly in less liquid, small cap stocks, where the underlying shares are traded on a wider spread and have higher associated dealing costs, will exhibit a wider bid to creation spread than funds predominantly transacting in more liquid, large cap stocks.</span></p>

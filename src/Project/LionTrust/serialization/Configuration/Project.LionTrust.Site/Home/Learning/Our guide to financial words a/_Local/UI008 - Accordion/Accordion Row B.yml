        <p><strong>Bear market:</strong> A market that is undergoing a prolonged fall or weakness driven by pessimism and negative sentiment. Technically, if a market falls 20%, it is a bear market.</p>
        <p><strong>Benchmark:</strong> The yardstick by which investment funds measure their performance. Fund managers typically try to outperform a certain benchmark. For example, a UK fund manager may benchmark their investment performance against the FTSE All Share index.</p>
        <p><strong>Beta:</strong> A measure of how closely an investment tracks the performance of its respective market.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Bid/Offer spread:</strong> Dual-priced funds have an offer (or buying) price and a bid (or selling) price and the difference between these is known as the bid-offer spread.</p>
        <p><strong>Black swan event:</strong> A rare event with unexpected consequences that are severe and widespread. Examples include the dotcom crash in 2000; the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic. It could also be a natural event such as a major catastrophe. Investors can help to protect their portfolios against black swan events by diversifying their portfolios and investing in funds managed by professional managers who are informed about financial markets. Such events could also be viewed as good buying opportunities because financial markets generally over-react initially to them, making assets cheaper, and invariably recover at some stage.</p>
        <p><strong>Blue chip:</strong> Denotes the biggest stocks listed on an exchange. The term derives from poker, where blue betting chips are traditionally of higher value than white or red ones.</p>
        <p><strong>Bond:</strong> Bonds are IOUs, or debt, issued by governments and corporations looking to raise cash. When you buy a bond, you are essentially lending out your money. They usually pay interest, and often have a set term to &ldquo;maturity&rdquo;, when the loan must be repaid, although some bonds never mature.&nbsp; Bonds are also known as fixed interest securities.</p>
        <p><strong>Book value:</strong> Also known as Net Asset Value (NAV), this is the value of a company, or an asset, according to its balance sheet. This term can be compared to market value to determine whether a company is under- or over-priced.</p>
        <p><strong>Bottom-up:</strong> Refers to an investment process, or approach, used by fund managers. Stocks are selected by analysing companies based solely on their investment quality and potential, regardless of their wider industry conditions and the macro-economic backdrop.</p>
        <p><strong>BRICs:</strong> Acronym for emerging market giants: Brazil, Russia, India and China. The term BRIC was coined by former Goldman Sachs director Jim O&rsquo;Neill in 2001 after he forecast the four countries&rsquo; economies would surpass those of the US and Japan by 2050.</p>
        <p><strong>Broker:</strong> Such as a stockbroker or insurance broker &ndash; a person or firm that executes buy and sell orders on behalf of investors. Brokers make their money via commissions from their trades.</p>
        <p><strong>Bull market:</strong> A &lsquo;bull market&rsquo; is City slang for a rising market for securities such as shares and / or bonds. It is characterised by optimism and investor confidence. Technically, a sustained 20% market rise is a bull market.</p>

        <p><strong>Oeic:</strong> An Open-Ended Investment Company is a fund which, unlike a unit trust, is legally structured as a company. An Oeic manager creates and redeems shares when investments and redemptions are made.</p>
        <p><strong>Ongoing Charges Figure (OCF):</strong> The OCF covers all the fees incurred for operating a fund throughout its financial year. These include the annual charge for managing the fund, administration and independent oversight functions, such as trustee, depository, custody, legal and audit fees. The OCF excludes portfolio transaction costs except for an entry/exit charge paid by the fund when buying or selling units in another fund. This will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term.</p>
        <p><strong>Open-ended:</strong> A type of investment fund in which units can be created and cancelled, depending on investors&rsquo; requirements to make or withdraw investments. Unit trusts and Oeics are examples of this.</p>

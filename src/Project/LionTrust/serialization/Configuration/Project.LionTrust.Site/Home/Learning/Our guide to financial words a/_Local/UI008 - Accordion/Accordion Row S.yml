        <p><strong>S&amp;P 500:</strong> An equity index that tracks the performance of the 500 largest companies listed on US stock exchanges. It is the country&rsquo;s main stock index.</p>
        <p><strong>Sector rotation:</strong>&nbsp;Selling investments in one industrial sector to move them into another, possibly because of a change in the economic environment.</p>
        <p><strong>Securitisation:</strong> The process of creating an investment that is secured against an underlying illiquid asset or group of assets. For example, debt from mortgages could be packaged together and the related securities could then be traded in the market.</p>
        <p><strong>Security:</strong> A financial asset such as a bond or equity that can be traded. Strict definitions of what constitutes a security can vary, depending on the jurisdictions in which the security is traded.</p>
        <p><strong>Self-Invested personal pension (SIPP):</strong> A personal pension plan that gives the holder significant freedom over how it is invested. The charging structures tend to favour larger pension pots.</p>
        <p><strong>Share buyback:</strong> A process in which companies either buy shares back from investors on the open market, or present shareholders with a tender offer in which they can redeem an allocation of their shares at a premium to the current market value. In cutting the number of shares in issue, businesses aim to increase the value of shares still available.</p>
        <p><strong>Share class:</strong> Companies and funds typically issue more than one class, whether it be shares or units. Different stock or share classes from the same company will have different obligations to their investors.</p>
        <p><strong>Shareholder:</strong> A person, company or organisation that owns shares in a company.</p>
        <p><strong>Shares in issue:</strong> The total number of shares currently attributable to a company, whether owned by the general public, large institutional investors, or employees of the company as part of their remuneration.</p>
        <p><strong>Shorting:</strong> A strategy used by professional investors where they bet that an asset, such as shares, will lose value. It involves borrowing shares and selling them on before buying them back at a later date, hopefully at a lower price, to return them to the original owner. If the price of the shares has risen, however, then the shorting party will lose money.</p>
        <p><strong>Single pricing:</strong> When shares and units in funds can be purchased and sold at the same price. This is more common today but historically many funds have had different &lsquo;bid&rsquo; and &lsquo;offer&rsquo; prices.</p>
        <p><strong>SIPP:</strong> A Self Invested Personal Pension is a pension wrapper that enables the holder to buy and sell investments such as funds and shares to match their needs and risk appetite. Some bespoke SIPP offerings even allow investors to hold physical commercial property.</p>
        <p><strong>Sustainable investment:</strong> An approach to investment that integrates Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations within the decision-making.</p>
        <p><strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):</strong> Established in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly, the 17 SDGs are inter-linked global goals by which to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all of humanity by the year 2030. They are usually used as the basis by which to measure the effects of impact investing.</p>
        <p><strong>Swap:</strong> A derivative contract in which two parties agree to swap the investment returns from two instruments. Common swaps include currency and interest rate swaps.</p>

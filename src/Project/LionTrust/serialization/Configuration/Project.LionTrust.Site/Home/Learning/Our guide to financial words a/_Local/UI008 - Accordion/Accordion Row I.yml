        <p><strong>Impact investing:</strong> Investing with the aim of bringing about positive and measurable Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) results while delivering financial returns. This goes beyond just &lsquo;negative screening&rsquo; or avoiding undesirable investments such as companies deemed to have harmful practices. Impact is usually measured with reference to the United Nations&rsquo; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
        <p><strong>Income drawdown:</strong> A pension feature which allows savers to remain invested during retirement while drawing an income from their pot. It is a riskier strategy than buying an annuity but it allows retirees to potentially enjoy the benefit of further growth in the value of their investments.</p>
        <p><strong>Income unit:</strong> The classification of an investment holding in a unit trust in which income from the assets held, possibly from share dividends, bond coupons or property rent, is paid to the investor as cash. This cash could be used to provide an income, or it could be used to buy more units in a fund.</p>
        <p><strong>Index:</strong> An equity index follows the performance of a particular group of shares on a stock market, often the largest - such as the UK FTSE 100 index or the US S&amp;P 500 index. An index tracker fund will mirror the performance of a particular index.</p>
        <p><strong>Individual Savings Account (ISA):</strong> A tax-efficient savings tax wrapper for UK savers, where the gains and returns are tax-free.</p>
        <p><strong>Inflation:</strong> The percentage measure of a rise in prices, usually expressed in annual terms. In the UK, the Consumers Price Index is based on a basket of goods and services chosen to reflect the general cost of living. Inflation reduces spending power and beating it is a core aim for many investors.</p>
        <p><strong>Initial Public Offering (IPO):</strong> An IPO, sometimes referred to as flotation, marks a company&rsquo;s stock market debut. It is the very first time it sells shares on a stock exchange to &lsquo;go public&rsquo;.</p>
        <p><strong>Investment Company with Variable Capital (ICVC):</strong> Similar to an Oeic, An ICVC is a fund which, unlike a unit trust, is legally structured as a company. The manager creates and redeems shares when investments and redemptions are made by investors.</p>
        <p><strong>Investment grade bonds:</strong> Corporate bonds that are issued by large, financially stable businesses, where the likelihood of default on the loan is deemed to be the lowest of all corporate bonds. Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s classifies Investment grade bonds as those rated BBB and above, while Moody&rsquo;s classifies them as Baa or higher.</p>
        <p><strong>Investment trust:</strong> An investment trust operates as an investment fund but it is a structured as a limited company, and its primary business is to invest its shareholders money. They are closed-ended, trading with a set amount of money, and are bought and sold on an exchange, such as the London Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p><strong>Investment Trust Discount:</strong> An investment trust trades at a discount when its share price is less than its net asset value. Given investment trusts are traded on the stock exchange, their share prices can fluctuate, based on demand and supply. If a trust is in great demand, its shares can trade at a premium i.e. at a greater value than their actual net worth.</p>

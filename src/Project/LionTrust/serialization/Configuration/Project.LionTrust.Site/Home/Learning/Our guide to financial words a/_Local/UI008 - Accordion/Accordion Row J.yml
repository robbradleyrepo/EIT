        <p><strong>Junior ISAs (JISAs):</strong> Like an ISA, a JISA is a tax efficient savings account, except they are designed to help families save or invest for their children. The money is not available to the child until they reach 18 years.</p>
        <p><strong>Junk bonds:</strong> A slang term for high-yield or non-investment grade corporate bonds. They are viewed as far higher risk than many bond investments, such as UK government bonds, and investment grade, as their issuer carries a greater chance of default. Credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s classifies junk bonds as those rated &lsquo;BB&rsquo; and below, while Moody&rsquo;s classifies them as &lsquo;Ba&rsquo; and lower.</p>

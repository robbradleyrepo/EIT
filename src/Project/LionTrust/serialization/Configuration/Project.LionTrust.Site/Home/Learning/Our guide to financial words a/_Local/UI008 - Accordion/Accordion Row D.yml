        <p><strong>Default risk:</strong> The probability that a borrower, including individuals, countries or companies, cannot pay a debt. Agencies such as Fitch ratings, Moody&rsquo;s and Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, provide credit ratings on companies and governments.</p>
        <p><strong>Deflation:</strong> Deflation is when the prices of goods and services decline. A country is in deflation if its inflation level drops below 0%. Prolonged bouts of deflation can be dangerous for an economy as consumers stop spending in the hope of buying something cheaper in future.</p>
        <p><strong>Derivative:</strong> A complex financial instrument that is a contract between two or more investors. Its value is determined by the fluctuating prices of underlying assets. Typically, these assets are stocks and bonds, but they can be linked to currencies, commodities and interest rates.</p>
        <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> A payment of interest or dividends to investors by the issuer (for example, a fund manager).</p>
        <p><strong>Diversification:</strong> Investing in a spread of assets to reduce risk. A portfolio invested in one company for example risks losing all its assets if that company goes bankrupt.</p>
        <p><strong>Dividend:</strong> The payout to shareholders of a company that shares its profits with its investors. They are usually paid quarterly, twice a year or annually.</p>
        <p><strong>Drawdown:</strong> The difference between the highest price and lowest price during a specific period, usually quoted as a percentage. Not to be confused with pension drawdown.</p>
        <p><strong>Dual pricing:</strong>&nbsp; When the sale and purchase prices of shares and units in funds are different at any given time. This is less common today but historically many funds have had an offer (buying) price and a bid (selling) price. The difference between these is known as the bid-offer spread.</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> A measure of the interest rate risk of a bond, or the sensitivity of the bond to changes in interest rates.&nbsp; The figure is expressed in years, representing the time required for the investor to recover the present value of the cash flows of a bond.</p>

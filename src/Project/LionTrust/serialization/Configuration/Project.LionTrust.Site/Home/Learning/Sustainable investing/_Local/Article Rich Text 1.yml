        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>Demand for sustainable<br /></span></strong><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">At Liontrust, we believe interest in sustainable investment can only grow as millennials inherit and generate increasing levels of wealth, and expect companies to adopt more responsible behaviour. Research we commissioned in 2021 found that 72% of discretionary fund managers and advisers said the proportion of clients investing sustainably had increased in the previous 12 months, compared to 59% in November 2019, and 77% of those questioned expected a further increase in the next 12 months. As for private investors, 75% said sustainability is important in their everyday life but of these, only 51% said they were investing sustainably and using socially responsible funds.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Beyond this growing consumer demand, we see two other factors behind growth in socially responsible and green investing. First is basic financial sense, with regulations and legislation increasing costs for polluting companies, providing significant impetus for efficiency improvements. Second is the political climate: the environment and related social impacts are now widely regarded as mainstream issues with policy decisions increasingly made with sustainability in mind. This political will has a marked effect on regulation in areas like carbon emissions, which in turn affects the competitive landscape for businesses.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>What is sustainable investing?<br /></span></strong><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Sustainable is a broad term and funds in this area can be badged as ethical, socially responsible, green or a number of other variations. Many still believe ‘ethical’ investing is simply about avoiding certain types of company – tobacco for example – and while a number of funds do take that approach, the market has become far more nuanced.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>For us, the central point is that sustainable investing is not only for those who want their investments to “do good”: there is a compelling case for all investors to take this approach and it is possible to make profits and have a positive impact. Ultimately, the name used to describe a fund is not that important; what is key is whether sustainable and environmental concerns are at the heart of decisions and stock selection.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Over 21 years, <span style="color: black;">the key to performance on our Liontrust Sustainable Future Funds has been investing in companies helping to make our world cleaner, healthier and safer. This highlights the importance of identifying structural growth and we continue to believe investors underestimate the speed, scale and persistency of such trends. </span></span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>In our fast-changing world, our team believes the companies that will thrive are those that improve people’s quality of life, increase the efficiency with which we use scarce resources, and enhance the safety of human activities. Examples might be a firm that makes technologies that lower carbon emissions for example, helps people live longer through medical innovation or helps provide clean water. In contrast, we feel companies whose interests are misaligned with those of society and the environment will simply not last the course.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>The Liontrust approach<br /></span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.25rem;">As long-term sustainable investors, we have faced questions over the years on whether ESG would survive the next downturn and Covid-19 has brought renewed scrutiny. Our answer remains firmly in the affirmative but rather than debating sustainability or social responsibility, we address the question via our investment process and funds.</span></p>
        <p class="Body" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">We start by </span><span style="color: black;">looking at the world through the prism of three mega trends, <em>Better</em> <em>resource efficiency </em>(cleaner),<em> Improved health </em>(healthier)<em> </em>and <em>Greater safety and resilience </em>(safer)<em>, </em>and 21 themes within these, focused on </span><span style="color: black;">the shift towards a more sustainable economy. </span>Building on this work, we also require <span>excellence in ESG (environment, social and governance) and our holdings tend to have </span>processes in place to manage customer relationships, employees and supply chains; we believe outperformance on these issues will deliver more resilient businesses over the long term. We bring this information into <span>our forecast earnings, only selecting companies that can make money from their good work, and the final part is an attractive valuation.</span></p>
        <p class="Body" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Taking our process step by step, because of our thematic work, our funds came into the Coronavirus crisis with no exposure to airlines, casinos, pub chains, luxury shopping or cruise ships, all sectors that suffered the worst declines. Because of steps two and three, on ESG and business fundamentals, we are largely invested in companies making products the world genuinely needs, demonstrating close relationships with their customers, treating employees with respect, and understanding the complexities of modern supply chains. Our view remains that as we look past Covid-19, the tools companies have developed to outperform in the face of a climate emergency, an obesity epidemic or failing boards will be the making of sustainable investment.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>Choosing sustainable funds </span></strong><strong><span style="color: black;">– and avoiding greenwashing<br /></span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.25rem;">As more funds launch into this market, with a dizzying array of names and approaches, it is important to identify ‘greenwashing’ in practice: where groups are talking up their credentials in this space without the expertise or track record to back it up.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">To highlight our own longevity and show up greenwashing in action, we have come up with five ways to tell whether funds, and teams behind them, are capable of meeting investors’ sustainable expectations.</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong><span style="color: black;">Transparency</span></strong><span style="color: black;">. A genuinely sustainable fund manager should be transparent about how they invest, as well as being open to be challenged. This should include clear and simple information explaining how the team runs money: what companies they look for under the sustainable approach and what they avoid. It should not be generic greenwash, with little more than meaningless ‘brochure’ comments like “sustainability is in our DNA”. Anyone can write a report on climate change, for example, but how are funds positioned in light of the huge challenges that combatting this will entail? </span>
            <p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong><span style="color: black;">Experience and resource.</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> As in any walk of life, experience and depth of a team is important when it comes to sustainable investing. We have a 13-strong team and 20 years of experience running sustainable funds.</span>
            <p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong><span style="color: black;">Knowledge and training</span></strong><span style="color: black;">. Sustainable investing is a specialist area and subjects like climate change are fast moving so investors need to be confident their managers have the required knowledge to run money in this way. This can be anything from members of the team having specialist qualifications to a general focus on training to ensure people understand the latest sustainability trends. </span>
            <p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong><span style="color: black;">Activism</span></strong><span style="color: black;">. Engagement is a key part of what we call sustainable investing and we feel managers should be able to highlight a track record of holding companies to account and encouraging them to improve. Managers should be able to talk in detail about their engagement priorities – whether diversity, tax transparency or plastic pollution – rather than making sweeping statements. It is worth looking at managers’ AGM voting records: do they vote with company management or actually challenge the businesses in which they invest to improve?</span>
            <p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong><span style="color: black;">Evidence</span></strong><span style="color: black;">. Ultimately you are looking for all this knowledge and experience in sustainability being applied to investment decisions – giving meaningfully different exposure compared to more conventional funds. Are managers able to show how their views are reflected in their decisions: is it simply ESG data and reporting for the sake of it or making a genuine difference to investment? </span></li>
        </ol>

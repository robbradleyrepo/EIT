        <p><strong>Real return:</strong> A measure in percentage terms of the return delivered by an investment that takes account of the impact of inflation or deflation, taxes and investment fees over a specific period. It can be calculated by subtracting the inflation/deflation rate, tax and investment fees from the nominal return.</p>
        <p><strong>Redemptions:</strong> The process by which an investment can be converted back to cash. The ease with which this can be done is often dictated by the liquidity &ndash; i.e. the number of potential buyers and sellers in the market for a specific asset &ndash; of the underlying investments.</p>
        <p><strong>Responsible investing:</strong> An approach to investment that integrates environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations within the decision-making.</p>
        <p><strong>Rights issue:</strong> The action by which a publicly listed firm issues new shares to existing shareholders in a bid to raise money. Existing shareholders have pre-emption rights to buy the shares before anyone else. A company might do this if it is in financial difficulty and needs more cash or if it wants to raise money for expansion. It will dilute the value of the shares already in issue.</p>
        <p><strong>Risk:</strong> The probability that an investment will deliver a negative return. Many factors can contribute to risk, such as inflation, the business environment, the wider economy and the personal qualities of a company&rsquo;s management. Inevitably, some investments incur higher risks than others but these can be addressed through diversification and investing in funds managed by investment professionals.</p>

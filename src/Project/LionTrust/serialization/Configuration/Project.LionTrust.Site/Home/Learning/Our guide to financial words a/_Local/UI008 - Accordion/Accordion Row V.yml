        <p><strong>Valuation point:</strong> The time of day at which the price of a fund is calculated.</p>
        <p><strong>VCT:</strong> Venture Capital Trusts are listed closed-ended funds that invest primarily in fledgling businesses that are not publicly listed on a stock exchange. There are strict rules governing what types of companies VCTs can invest in. VCTs are typically viewed as higher risk than investments in large, listed companies but if you hold your shares in a VCT for at least five years you get income tax relief in the UK and there is no Capital Gains Tax on profits from selling your shares.</p>
        <p><strong>Volatility:</strong> Volatility is sometimes used interchangeably with risk but ultimately refers to how much and how quickly an asset class moves up and down within a certain timeframe. The more and the faster it moves, the more volatile is an investment considered to be.</p>

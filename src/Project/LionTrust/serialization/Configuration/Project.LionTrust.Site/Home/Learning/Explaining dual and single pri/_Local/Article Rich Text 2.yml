        <p style="color: #222222; margin: 0px 0px 12px;"><strong>Single priced funds</strong></p>
        <p>Our range of UK-domiciled single priced funds are ICVCs (Investment Company with Variable Capital) and our Ireland-domiciled single priced funds are OEICs (open-ended investment company).</p>
        <p>Shares in ICVCs and OEICs are bought or sold at the same single price, which is directly linked to the value of the fund&rsquo;s underlying investments and therefore there is no bid-offer spread. An ICVC and OEIC fund, however, can apply a swinging price dilution adjustment to protect existing shareholders from the costs of buying and selling underlying investments that are incurred as other investors join or leave the fund. The dilution adjustment will effectively swing the price from the single mid-price to either a bid or offer single price for investors joining or leaving the fund. This is usually applied when there are large inflows or outflows given that the associated costs can dilute the value of the fund for existing investors. Please refer to the fund prospectus for full details of when an adjustment may be implemented.
        </p>

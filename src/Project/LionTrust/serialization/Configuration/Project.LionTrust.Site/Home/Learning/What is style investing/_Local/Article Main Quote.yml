      Value: "There are two main approaches, or ‘styles’, associated with investing in equities – value and growth. Growth investing focuses on companies that are expected to grow faster than others in the market. Value investors focus on buying stocks they believe are under-priced because the market has overlooked their true potential and this will be corrected in the future."

        <p><strong>Yield curve:</strong> A line on a graph that plots the interest rates of similar bonds with different lengths of time to maturity, such as three-month, two-year, five-year and 30-year government bonds. The curve reflects market expectations and it can be analysed for signals of future changes in interest rates and economic activity.</p>

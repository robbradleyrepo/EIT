        <p style="color: #222222; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 14px; margin-left: 0px;">Various methods and tools have been developed to help determine an individual&rsquo;s risk tolerance, including questionnaires and personality tests. Ultimately, the level of risk you are prepared to take will often come down to how much money you are prepared to lose before you start worrying.</p>
        <p style="color: #222222; margin: 0px 0px 14px;">Your capacity for loss can be expressed in terms of how much capital you are prepared to lose during any 12-month period and how much capital you are willing to lose over the length of time you will be invested. The longer your time horizon for investment, the greater the level of risk you can potentially take.</p>
        <p style="color: #222222; margin: 0px 0px 14px;">It is equally important, however, to consider the amount of risk you need to take to achieve your investment objectives within your time frame. Take too little risk and you may not reach your financial goals.</p>
        <p style="color: #222222; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">Choosing a risk profile, therefore, involves targeting sufficient risk to achieve your investment goals, but also ensuring that this level does not exceed your risk tolerance and capacity.</p>

        <p><strong>Accumulation unit/share:</strong> The classification of a unit or share in an investment fund that reinvests income from the underlying assets, possibly from share dividends, bond coupons or property rent. The unit or share price is then adjusted to reflect the income, which is not taxed, although the final return is treated as a capital gain or loss. Funds with accumulation units or shares can be denoted with the suffix &lsquo;Acc&rsquo;.</p>
        <p><strong>Active investment:</strong> A strategy where an investor (often a fund manager) makes active decisions about where, when and how to buy, sell, or hold equities, bonds or other financial instruments. It is distinct from passive investment, by which a benchmark, such as the FTSE 100 Index, is duplicated and tracked.</p>
        <p><strong>AIM:</strong> Formerly the Alternative Investment Market, AIM is part of the London Stock Exchange. Launched in 1995 with just 10 companies, it lists smaller fledgling firms that can enjoy more regulatory flexibility compared with the larger companies on the main market, such as those in the FTSE 100. In the UK, some AIM shares are free from inheritance tax if held for more than two years.</p>
        <p><strong>Alpha:</strong> A measure that indicates how a fund has performed when compared with its benchmark (often an index such as the FTSE 100) when adjusted for the risks taken. Alpha is often expressed as a percentage versus the performance of its benchmark.</p>
        <p><strong>Alternative investments:</strong> Investments outside of the three main asset classes of equities, bonds and cash. These include investments such as real estate, private equity, commodities and hedge funds.<br />
        Annuity: Typically sold by life insurers, an annuity is a financial product which, in return for a lump sum, provides a guaranteed income every year for the rest of the retiree&rsquo;s life or a specified period.</p>
        <p><strong>Asset class:</strong> An asset class is a term used to categorise different types of investment that share similar characteristics. For example, stocks, bonds and property are three types of asset class.</p>
        <p><strong>Assets under management (AUM):</strong> The total value of the assets, including cash, held within a fund or managed as a whole by a fund management company.&nbsp;</p>

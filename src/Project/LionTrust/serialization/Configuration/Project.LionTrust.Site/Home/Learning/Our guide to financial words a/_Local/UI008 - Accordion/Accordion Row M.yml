        <p><strong>M&amp;A:</strong> A common phrase meaning Merger &amp; Acquisition.&nbsp; A merger is when two firms join forces to create a new corporation. An acquisition is the purchase of another company, which is absorbed into the buying firm.</p>
        <p><strong>Market capitalisation:</strong> Calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of shares in issue, market capitalisation represents the total value of a company&rsquo;s shares. When combined with the total value of a company&rsquo;s debt (and other small adjustments), this gives the &lsquo;Enterprise Value&rsquo;, or total value, of a company.</p>
        <p><strong>Multi-Asset:</strong> A fund or portfolio that invests across various asset classes to diversify sources of return and risk. As well as investing in other funds, multi-asset products can also invest in individual shares, bonds, property, cash and commodities such as gold.</p>
        <p><strong>Multi-manager:</strong> A fund/portfolio that invests in other funds: this can either be fettered (using the fund manager&rsquo;s own fund range) or unfettered (free to invest across the whole market). Similarly, multi-manager funds can focus on particular asset classes (equities for example) or take a multi-asset approach.</p>
        <p><strong>Mutual fund:</strong> An investment vehicle that pools money from many investors and invests in a range of assets. The key advantage is that it provides economies of scale and gives individual investors access to a diversified portfolio.&nbsp; Examples of mutual funds include unit trusts, Oeics and investment trusts.</p>

        <p><strong>CEO:</strong> Chief executive officer &ndash; the boss or highest-ranking employee at a firm. A CEO&rsquo;s prime responsibility is management of the business.</p>
        <p><strong>CGT:</strong> In the UK, Capital Gains Tax is the levy you pay on any profits made when selling something that has risen in value. It is important to remember that it is the gain which is taxed &ndash; not the full sale price. For example, if an investment is bought for &pound;100 and sold later for &pound;150, &pound;50 would be subject to CGT. The annual tax-free allowance, which is known as the Annual Exempt Amount, allows you to make a certain amount of gain each year before you must pay tax.</p>
        <p><strong>Closed-ended:</strong> A type of investment fund in which the number of shares or units are fixed at any given time. Investment trusts are examples of this, with investors having to buy or sell shares to invest or divest. Investment trusts can create more shares through new issues, however, and can conduct share buy-backs to reduce the number.</p>
        <p><strong>Commodities:</strong> Commodities are natural resources and raw materials, ranging from oil to gold. Includes &lsquo;hard&rsquo; commodities such as industrial and precious metals, as well as &lsquo;soft&rsquo; commodities such as agricultural produce, including coffee and wheat.</p>
        <p><strong>Corporate bond:</strong> An IOU, or debt, issued by businesses to raise cash. Corporate bonds, like government bonds, pay interest and usually have a set maturity period. Generally, companies pay interest in two instalments a year, although this can vary.</p>
        <p><strong>Coupon:</strong> A coupon is the term used for the interest paid periodically on a bond, expressed as a percentage of the bond&rsquo;s par value (the value at which it was bought). Because the bond&rsquo;s price will differ from its par value, the running yield (coupon/price) or yield-to-redemption (the expected yield if the bond is held to maturity) usually gives a better measure of the investment return from owning a bond.</p>

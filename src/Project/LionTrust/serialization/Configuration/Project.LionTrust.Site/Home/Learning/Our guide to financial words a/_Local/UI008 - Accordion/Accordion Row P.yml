        <p><strong>Passive investment:</strong> A strategy in which a benchmark, such as the FTSE 100 Index, is duplicated and tracked. Funds using this strategy, sometimes known as tracker funds or index trackers, are often run by robots (or algorithms) rather than fund managers making active investment decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>PE Ratio:</strong> The Price to Earnings Ratio is a common method of valuing a company. It is calculated by dividing a company&rsquo;s share price by its earnings per share.</p>
        <p><strong>Pound cost averaging:</strong>&nbsp; A strategy by which investors can diversify their risk across time. Investing a substantial lump sum in one go can run the risk of subjecting the whole capital to a market fall soon after. Regular monthly investments, for example, can help smooth exposure to fluctuations in the market.</p>
        <p><strong>Premium:</strong> The difference between an asset&rsquo;s market price and its net asset value when the former is higher. For example, an investment trust&rsquo;s shares can trade at a premium to its actual net worth if it is in high demand.</p>
        <p><strong>Private equity:</strong> Shares held in a company that is not listed on a public stock exchange. Individuals and other entities such as companies and funds can hold private equity.</p>
        <p><strong>Profit warning:</strong> An announcement from a company to the stock market that its profits are likely to be less than anticipated. Typically, a profit warning is flagged up a few weeks before a firm publishes its latest results in a bid to manage shareholder expectations.</p>

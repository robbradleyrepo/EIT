      Value: Everyone knows it is risky to ‘put all your eggs in one basket.’ The same principle applies to investing. It is better to diversify investments across a range of assets rather than just invest in a few. This reduces the risk that a portfolio’s performance could be dragged down by too much exposure to a few bad investments.

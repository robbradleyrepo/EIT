        <p><strong>Leveraging:</strong> The borrowing of money or capital with the aim of increasing the potential returns on an investment. Leverage can amplify losses as well as gains. Investment trusts can leverage but it is illegal for units trusts to do so.</p>
        <p><strong>LIBOR:</strong> London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is the global benchmark interest rate at which banks lend money to each other for short-term loans. LIBOR is widely viewed as a barometer of how confident banks are in each other&rsquo;s financial strength.</p>
        <p><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be converted into cash. Shares which can be bought or sold rapidly on the stock market are considered to be liquid assets whereas a commercial property is more illiquid because it can take longer to sell.</p>

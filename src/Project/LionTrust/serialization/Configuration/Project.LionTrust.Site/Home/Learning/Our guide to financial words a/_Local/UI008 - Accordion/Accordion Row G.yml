        <p><strong>Gearing:</strong> The ratio of a corporation&rsquo;s debt to the value of its ordinary shares. Investment trusts often borrow to amplify investor returns.</p>
        <p><strong>Government bonds:</strong> IOUs, or debt, issued by governments to raise cash. They pay interest, usually fixed, and have a set maturity. UK government bonds are known as gilts while US government bonds are called treasuries.</p>
        <p><strong>Greenwashing:</strong> A play on the term &lsquo;whitewashing&rsquo;, this is the practice of providing misleading information about an investment, company or project to make it appear more environmentally friendly than it really is.</p>

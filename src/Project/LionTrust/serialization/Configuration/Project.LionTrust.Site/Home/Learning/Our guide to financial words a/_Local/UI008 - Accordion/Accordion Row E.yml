        <p><strong>Emerging market:</strong> A developing country that typically has a fast-growing economy. Examples include Brazil, Mexico and Russia.</p>
        <p><strong>Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS):</strong> These were launched in the UK to help smaller companies to raise cash by offering a range of tax incentives to investors who invest in such companies. An EIS gives income tax relief of 30 per cent and investors pay no capital gains tax on profits once the investment has been held for three years.</p>
        <p><strong>Equities (Shares/Stocks):</strong> These give the owner part ownership of a company, the right to a portion of the profits and a vote at annual general meetings. They usually trade on a stock exchange, where prices are determined by supply and demand.</p>
        <p><strong>ESG:</strong> Environmental, Social and Governance are the widely recognised criteria used to assess the &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo; of an investment.</p>
        <p><strong>Exchange traded fund (ETF):</strong> An ETF is a security, or share, that tracks a particular index, such as the FTSE 100, or the price of a commodity, such as gold. Unlike a tracker fund, they are traded on a stock exchange and can be bought and sold while the market is open.</p>

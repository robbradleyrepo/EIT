        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><strong><span>Stock markets explained</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Stock markets can be daunting, especially for beginners. Yet the banks of flashing green and red numbers that depict rapid share price moves and look impenetrable to the untrained eye represent where many of us invest much of our life savings and pensions.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>Share prices are driven up and down by a vast amount of information that changes rapidly and requires expertise to understand.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>But whether we already invest in stocks and shares or are beginners looking to take the first step towards building&nbsp;wealth, it is worth taking the time to understand how stock markets work and how we can use them to make money.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><strong><span>What is a stock market?</span></strong><span> </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">A ‘stock market’, or ‘stock exchange’, is a market like any other. But instead of fruit, vegetables or houses, the buyers and sellers trade shares in companies.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>One share, or ‘equity’, gives the holder a part ownership in a company, and therefore the right to receive a portion of its profits and vote at annual general meetings. </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>One share only represents a very small part of ownership though: the ‘public’ companies listed on stock markets each issue millions, or even billions, of shares.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><strong><span>How do stock markets work?</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Share prices float freely on the stock market, driven by demand and supply. If a company looks to be doing well its share price will rise on the expectations of higher future profits. But if its cash flows are threatened, perhaps because of negative market conditions, new competitors, strikes, a recession, tax rises or a war, then its share price will fall.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>Interest rates can also impact share prices. If the central bank raises the base rate and the interest rises on bank accounts then investors might be tempted to switch their investments out of equities, reducing demand and pushing down their prices. If interest rates fall, shares become more attractive.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>Share prices can fluctuate a lot during a stock market’s trading hours. A share’s price reflects whatever the market thinks it is worth at any given moment. It is based on the consensus opinion of thousands of investors who react rapidly with fear or greed to the latest information.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>These are often over-reactions, however, so the resulting volatility can be used to advantage by traders and other investors who buy shares when they are out of favour and cheap and sell them when they are popular and fully priced. As the famous investor Warren Buffett says, you should be “greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.”<br /></span></p><p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><br /></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>Stock markets around the world list thousands of companies but their general performances are represented by flagship ‘indices’. These indices usually track the combined performance of a group of the largest companies’ shares. For example, the FTSE 100 tracks the performance of the largest 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><strong><span>Can you make money off the stock market?</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>Patience often pays off for those with the nerve to ride out stock market volatility: over longer periods, shares tend to deliver strong positive returns. In some cases, equities have delivered returns several times that of the original investment. These returns are often inflation-proof too because companies seek to raise prices for their goods and services in line with it so their profits rise. Such returns are hard to achieve by placing money in savings accounts. </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>But shareholders can lose money if the company does not do well or even goes bust. It is important, especially for beginners, to diversify their risk by investing in several companies and not ‘put all their eggs in one basket’.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>Investors can reduce risk by investing in several companies to create a portfolio of shares. However, for most investors, both beginners and experienced alike, it is much easier to reduce risk by investing in an investment fund, such as the unit trusts, open-ended investment companies (Oeics) and investment companies with variable capital (ICVCs) offered by Liontrust.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>These pool together the investments of hundreds and even thousands of investors, who can see their investments diversified across a range of companies, sectors and countries to reduce risk.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><strong><span>How to buy shares?</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>General members of the public are not authorised to buy and sell shares at the stock exchange. Investors can buy shares by going to a broker or investment platform. There was a time when brokers had high street offices all over the country but now many of them offer their services online as do the investment platforms.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>Brokers may charge a commission, either as a percentage of the trade value or a flat fee, on purchases and sales. This will be higher if they provide advice on which stocks to buy and sell and there will be an annual management fee if your shares are held on their electronic platform. Investment platforms may charge a set fee.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>The prices at which shares are bought and sold are different. This difference is known as the bid-offer spread and can be more than 1% of a trade. A stamp duty of 0.5% is payable on stock purchases and if you buy shares on a foreign stock market then there will be a currency exchange fee. </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>It can be more cost-effective to invest in shares using investment funds such as those offered by Liontrust. Economies of scale mean these funds can spread the cost of trading shares among a high number of investors.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 3pt 0cm;"><span>If the fund is ‘actively managed’ then they will be run by professionals who are experienced at analysing market information to create a portfolio of stocks on behalf of their investors. They assess economic and market data daily and the accounts of individual companies, often meeting the senior management to gauge their thoughts on their companies’ prospects.</span></p>

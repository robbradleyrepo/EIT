        <p><strong>Finance Director (FD):</strong> The person responsible for the financial health of a company. Duties will include managing financial statements and results and ensuring financial, fiscal and tax related obligations are met.</p>
        <p><strong>Financial Conduct Authority:</strong> The City regulator formerly known as the Financial Services Authority. The FCA oversees and checks financial firms providing services and products to UK consumers.</p>
        <p><strong>Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS):</strong> The FSCS is a free service and the UK&rsquo;s compensation scheme of last resort for customers dealing with authorised financial services firms. The organisation only pays customers compensation if a company is unable to do so, usually as a result of going bust.</p>
        <p><strong>Fixed income:</strong> Another term for bond related investments. Fixed income assets are IOUs issued by governments and companies. They pay annual interest and normally repay the amount borrowed to the bond holder at the end of a fixed term, although some fixed income instruments are non-maturing.</p>
        <p><strong>Floating Rate Notes (FRNs):</strong> Bonds with floating &ndash; rather than fixed &ndash; coupon payments that are linked to a reference interest rate. The interest rate sensitivity or duration of FRNs is typically lower than similar, fixed coupon bonds.</p>
        <p><strong>Frontier market:</strong> Developing countries that are less advanced than emerging markets. They can have fast-growing economies but also tend to pose higher risks.</p>
        <p><strong>FTSE 100:</strong> The FTSE 100 is an index comprised of the 100 largest listed UK firms, often dubbed &lsquo;blue-chips&rsquo;, listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).</p>
        <p><strong>Fund:</strong> A pooled investment. Typically run by a fund manager who uses investors&rsquo; money to invest in a wide range of assets, such as stocks or bonds, with the aim of delivering capital growth and/or income.</p>
        <p><strong>Fund-of-funds:</strong> Sometimes known as a multi-manager fund, a fund of funds is an investment portfolio that invests in a range of other funds rather than directly in individual stocks or securities.</p>
        <p><strong>Fund share classes:</strong> Fund managers often provide different versions of fund units &ndash; or shares &ndash; for investors to buy. These can include an income unit (usually abbreviated to &ldquo;inc&rdquo;) or an accumulation unit (usually abbreviated to &ldquo;acc&rdquo;).</p>
        <p><strong>Fund supermarket:</strong> An online platform where investors can buy, sell and hold investment funds. Buying an investment via a fund supermarket tends to be cheaper than buying directly from the provider. Many of these platforms also allow customers to trade other instruments, such as shares, ETFs, or currencies.</p>
        <p><strong>Futures:</strong> Futures are a type of derivative commonly used in relation to commodities, currencies and stock markets. They involve purchasing an asset at an agreed price for delivery on a future date.</p>

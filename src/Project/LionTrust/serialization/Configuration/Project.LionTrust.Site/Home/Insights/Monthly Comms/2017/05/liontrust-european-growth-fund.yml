        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund returned 2.7%* in sterling terms in April, compared with the 0.6% return from the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index.</strong></p>
        <p>European equities rallied at the end of the month after a benign result in the first round of the French presidential election. Centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen ended as the two front runners ahead of the second round of voting in May. Markets had been concerned about growing support for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon and the prospect of a far-left versus far-right battle. However, Macron’s victory in the first round has provided a clear favourite. The euro appreciated by 1.4% in trade-weighted terms between the result’s announcement and the end of the month, while the MSCI Europe ex-UK index returned 2.6% in local currency terms. However, the euro fell versus the pound (-0.8%), which itself jumped after UK Prime Minister May called a surprise snap election. </p>
        <p>The spread between France’s 10-year government bond yield and German Bunds shrank to 50 basis points, its lowest level since January, displaying an easing in investors’ concern over political risk. In the run up to the election, the yield gap had widened to c.80 basis points, a level not seen since the eurozone crisis in 2012. </p>
        <p>Within the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index, the financials sector reacted positively to the French election result (+1.9%), boosted by the perception of a more certain path for the French economy and eurozone if Macron were to win. A ‘risk-on’ reaction saw other cyclical sectors perform strongly, including industrials (+3.5%) and consumer discretionary (+2.6%). Within the Fund’s holdings, construction and civil engineering company Peab (+10.6%), German construction company Hochtief (5.4%) and car components supplier CIE Automotive (+5.5%) benefited from this trend.</p>
        <p>The worst performing sectors in the MSCI Europe ex UK index were telecoms (-3.5%), utilities (-2.7%) and energy (-2.7%). Of the Fund’s holdings, Fred Olsen Energy (-30.6%), Total (-1.8%), Endesa (-3.1%) and Red Electrica (-1.9%) were exposed to this weakness. </p>
        <p>However, oil &amp; gas producer OMV (+13.1%) bucked the trend of poor energy sector returns and was one of the Fund’s biggest contributors in April. The company revealed at the end of the month that its first quarter clean operating result (on a current cost of supply basis) was significantly above analyst consensus expectations.</p>
        <p>Swiss dentistry company Straumann Holding (+11.1%) announced strong first quarter results. Group revenue was up 20% year-on-year and it achieved double-digit organic growth across all divisions. The group also raised full-year guidance for organic growth to a low-double digit percentage range from a high single-digit range it had previously predicted in its full-year results.</p>
        <p>Of the detractors from the Fund, Norsk Hydro (-4.8%) released first-quarter results at the end of the month which disappointed against market expectations. Norsk Hydro’s operating profit came in at NOK2.3bn versus the Bloomberg consensus forecast of NOK2.8bn, though the company was upbeat on global primary demand. </p>
        <p>In keeping with the Cashflow Solution investment process, April saw the initial implementation of changes to the portfolio resulting from our annual review of companies’ reports and accounts. New positions were opened in Sydbank, Moncler, Hexpol, Covestro, and Nokian Renkaat. Swedish Match was removed from the portfolio.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>OMV (+13.1%), Straumann Holding (+11.1%) and Peab (+10.6%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Fred Olsen Energy (-30.6%), Banco BPM (-5.1%) and Norsk Hydro (-4.8%).</p>

        <p>• Past performance is not a guide to future performance. • Do remember that the value of an investment and the income from it can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.&nbsp;• Some of the Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team invest in smaller companies. These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. • The European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio which could mean that it will be volatile when compared to its benchmark. • The Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.</p>

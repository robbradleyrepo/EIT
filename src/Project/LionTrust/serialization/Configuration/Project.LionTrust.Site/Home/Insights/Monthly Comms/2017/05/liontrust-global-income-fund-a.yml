        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>The Fund returned -3.0%* in sterling terms in April, compared with the -1.6% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</strong></span></p>
        <p>Global equities fell in April in sterling terms due to a jump in the pound following UK Prime Minster Theresa May’s surprise decision to call a snap election to be held on 8 June. Trade-weighted sterling rose 1.6% over the month, with opinion polls pointing to a strong Conservative majority, and investors welcoming the prospect of continuity on the UK political front. The MSCI World index posted a -1.9% return in sterling terms but a +1.2% return in local currency terms.</p>
        <p>In European markets, there was a positive response to the result of the first round of the French presidential election. Centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen ended as the two front runners ahead of the second round of voting in May, which Macron is widely expected to win. ‘Trumpflation’ continued to support US stock indices, with the S&amp;P 500 close to an all-time high. However, investors were underwhelmed by the president’s proposal to cut corporate tax to 15% from 35% due to the lack of detail, particularly around the funding of the cut. </p>
        <p>No sector in the MSCI World Index generated a positive total return in sterling terms in April. Consumer discretionary (-0.5%) performed the best, while energy (-5.4%), telecoms (-4.9%) and financials (-2.7%) were the heaviest fallers.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The Fund’s underperformance versus the MSCI World index was partially due to its high exposure to a weak energy sector, with Fred Olsen Energy (-30.6%), Ensign Energy Services (-10.2%) and Lukoil (-9.4%) among the biggest detractors. Oil prices being under pressure from ever increasing US oil production and the reopening of Libya’s biggest oil field. Brent crude traded at US$51.73 a barrel at the end of the month, having reached a high of over US$56 a barrel earlier in April. The Fund’s overweight exposure to other value-oriented sectors such as telecoms and financials was also a headwind. </p>
        <p>In addition there were a couple of stock specific disappointments. Canadian residential mortgage insurer Genworth MI Canada (-13.0%) was one of the worst performers in the Fund. The stock was hit after mortgage lender Home Capital Group disclosed a C$2bn new loan to help mitigate dwindling deposits, sparking concerns about the alternative lending space. Genworth confirmed that Home Capital originated mortgages represented around 1% of its overall business at the end of March.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Seagate Technology (-11.2%) gave back some of its 2017 gains after reporting results for its financial third quarter to the end of March. The data storage company’s adjusted earnings per share came in ahead of the Bloomberg compiled consensus forecast, though revenue missed. The company’s outlook for fourth quarter revenue of between US$2.5bn-US$2.6bn was also slightly below consensus forecast of US$2.7bn.</p>
        <p>In terms of changes to the Fund’s portfolio during April, we sold the holding in Swiss Reinsurance and initiated a position in Nokian Renkaat.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Marks &amp; Spencer Group (+8.8%), Standard Life (+6.3%) and Actividades de Construcción y Servicios Group (+5.3%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Medical Facilities (-16.2%), Genworth MI Canada (-13.0%) and Seagate Technology (-11.2%).</p>

        <p>• Past performance is not a guide to future performance. • Do remember that the value of an investment and the income from it can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.&nbsp;• Some of the Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team invest in smaller companies. These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. • The European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio which could mean that it will be volatile when compared to its benchmark. • The Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.</p>

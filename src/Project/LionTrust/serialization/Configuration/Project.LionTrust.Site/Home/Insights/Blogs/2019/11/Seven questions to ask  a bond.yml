        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="color: black;">These are dangerous times for bond investors. Fixed income markets are expensive, with yields low and some short-dated bonds even having negative yields, while there is a record high level of risk. Even government bonds are not the safe haven they are popularly portrayed as.<br>
        <br>
        </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><img alt="Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index" src="-/media/082D52E218DB43C39AFEE961B81F66DE.ashx?h=338&amp;w=601" class="custom-image-height-auto" style="height: 338px; width: 601px;"></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;"><br>
        Does this mean investors should avoid fixed income markets altogether? The answer is not entirely, as there are still opportunities to generate returns. But investors must be selective: don&rsquo;t just buy exposure to the market, understand the level of risk you are taking and ensure your bond holdings are liquid. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">Are fixed income funds positioned to take advantage of the opportunities and to avoid excessive risk in the market? Here are seven questions that investors should be asking their fund managers.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="color: black;">1. Are bonds expensive?</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">&ldquo;We own bonds because investors need them and expect us to own them&rdquo; is not an acceptable answer from fund managers. We, as fund managers, should be honest with investors when an asset class is expensive.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="color: black;">2. Do your fund managers believe there is long-term value in the asset class despite the high prices? </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">I guess it is possible for prices to rise in the short term. But let&rsquo;s face it, a fund must sell all its bonds at some point to avoid making a loss. So, is this just a short-term &ldquo;punt&rdquo;? Have your fund managers clearly explained their strategy for how they will do this?</span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="color: black;">3. What is the fund&rsquo;s exposure to long maturity bonds? </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">Many funds have significant exposures to long maturity bonds. If this is the case with your fund, ask the managers why they have this weighting. A large exposure means the fund is taking more risk for their investors than ever.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">We know bond prices in most cases are at all-time highs and that markets have been heavily manipulated. We know that &ldquo;holding to maturity&rdquo; is likely to leave clients with losses in real terms and quite possibly in nominal terms too. What is the fund manager&rsquo;s plan to exit their long maturity positions?</span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="color: black;">4. Who will buy your fund&rsquo;s bonds?</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">Quantitative easing (QE) programmes are being wound down. Central bankers are calling for more fiscal support. The chances of further mass buying from price insensitive agencies seems to have reduced as, belatedly, they recognise the damage done by QE and her friends. Who else is likely to buy these negative return assets? Who is that greater fool?</span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="color: black;">5. What are the risks your fund is taking for what are likely, at best, to be skinny rewards?</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: black;">We gave up &ldquo;managing to index&rdquo; or really caring about peers a couple of years ago. If something is wrong for the investor, don&rsquo;t fund managers have a duty of care to protect her or him irrespective of what &ldquo;the competition&rdquo; is doing? What is your fund manager doing to try to mitigate losses for investors?</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;"></span><span style="color: black;"><img alt="10 year average G7 bond yield" src="-/media/D7E0BCC1245546AD98C55B0CBF1FD78B.ashx?h=338&amp;w=601" class="custom-image-height-auto" style="height: 338px; width: 601px;"></span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;"><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Have the fund managers changed strategy?</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Most fixed income funds are likely to have generated much more than 100% returns for investors over the last decade. That was easy. Have your fund managers changed strategy given that valuations today bear no relation to those a decade ago? Your fund managers should be working hard on finding alpha after so many years of markets rising.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Why not invest in a passive fund?</strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">There is little merit investing in passive funds in this market environment. They are mandated to chase record prices for record risk.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span></p>

        <strong>Key Risks&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #222222;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.<br>

        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund&rsquo;s A5 share class returned -0.8%* in euro terms in August (A4 share class -0.9%). This compares with the -0.6% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index.</strong></p>
        <p>The continued strengthening of the euro in August limited stock gains in Europe, with the currency touching its highest level against the dollar since January 2015, and its highest level against the pound since late 2009. Within the minutes of the ECB&rsquo;s July meeting, the Governing Council voiced concern that the strength of the currency could damage the euro area&rsquo;s economic recovery.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, geopolitical tension between the US and North Korea weighed on global stocks in August. North Korea&rsquo;s missile testing sparked a war of words between the two countries&rsquo; volatile leaders. Trump warned that North Korea would be met with &ldquo;fire and fury like the world has never seen&rdquo; while North Korea responded by suggesting Kim Jong Un was considering a strike on US territory of Guam. The escalation in hostility between the two leaders hurt global equities and propped up safe havens such as gold, which rose 4.1% in August. However, despite the rise in gold prices, <strong>Centamin </strong>(-10.2%), was one of the biggest detractors from performance. The gold miner&rsquo;s revenue for the first six months of 2017 fell 11% year-on-year while profit before tax fell 41%. These declines were driven by lower gold output and higher cost of production for the period. </p>
        <p>There was, nonetheless, a good performance from the Fund&rsquo;s materials holdings overall, with <strong>Evraz </strong>(+49.2%) and <strong>Ferrexpo </strong>(+23.2%) among the top gainers in August. Steel maker Evraz recorded rises in both revenue and profit for the six months to end of June, citing positive momentum in steel markets. Iron ore producer Ferrexpo&rsquo;s interim profit soared in the same period due to significantly higher pellet premium prices.</p>
        <p>The materials sector in the MSCI Europe Index rose 1.3% in euro terms, beaten only by utilities (+4.0%) and real estate (+1.5%). The biggest fallers in August were financials (-3.4%), telecoms (-3.0%) and energy (-1.8%). </p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white;"><strong>Straumann Holding </strong>(+12.3%) was another holding to report upbeat interim results. The dental company&rsquo;s revenue for the first half of 2017 climbed 18% compared to the same period last year. In addition to the results, Straumann announced that it is entering into the field of orthodontic dentistry with the acquisition of ClearCorrect for US$150m and increasing stakes in Geniova Technologies and Dental Wings.</p>
        <p><strong>Hunting </strong>(-16.4%) was among the detractors. The oil services company&rsquo;s share price gradually declined through the month despite a small spike following its interim results, in which it reported a narrower loss compared to the same time last year and a 40% year-on-year rise in revenue. <strong>Lenzing Group</strong> (-12.3%) similarly saw its share price decrease despite strong half-year numbers. The Austrian textile fibres producer registered record revenue and EBITDA for the first half of 2017. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Evraz (+49.2%), Ferrexpo (+23.2%) and Straumann Holding (+12.3%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Hunting (-16.4%), Lenzing (-12.3%) and Centamin(-10.2%).</p>

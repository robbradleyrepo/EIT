        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Growth Fund returned 3.4%* in February compared with the 3.1% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></p>
        <p>UK equities sustained their strong start to 2017, keeping pace with the rise in global equity markets: the MSCI World Index of developed markets rose 3.5%. Within this rally there was something of a recovery in relative terms for some defensive sectors which were left behind during the reflation rally in the second half of 2016. Healthcare (+6.2%) telecoms (+3.0%), and utilities (+1.8%) were among those sectors to benefit. </p>
        <p>The Fund’s pharmaceutical holdings strengthened, helped by this improving investor sentiment towards the sector, as well as news flow from both AstraZeneca (+14.5%) and Shire (+10.8%).</p>
        <p>Shire’s 2016 growth numbers (sales +78%) are flattered by the inclusion of Baxalta sales following the $32bn acquisition mid-way through the year. Ex-Baxalta, sales growth was still very robust at 15% and the results were marginally ahead of expectations. By contrast, AstraZeneca’s 2016 numbers were slightly below consensus as revenues contracted 5% in constant currency terms due to the patent expiry of its Crestor drug. The company is, however, confident that it has a well-stocked late-stage pipeline which will offset the decline. Later in the month AstraZeneca announced positive results from a phase III trial for its Lynparza cancer treatment.</p>
        <p>The largest individual portfolio riser in February was Unilever (+19.3%). It received a bid approach from US consumer goods peer Kraft Heinz, which was quickly withdrawn as it became clear that Unilever was in no mood to entertain a friendly takeover. We have found takeover offers for Fund holdings to be a reasonably frequent feature which is reflective of the appeal others see in the core Economic Advantage assets which we seek out. In this instance, the failed deal appears to have triggered both accelerated action on behalf of Unilever’s management and a reassessment of the company’s prospects among investors. Since rejecting the approach, Unilever has announced the initiation of a “comprehensive review” of its business – due to complete in April – and upgraded guidance for 2017’s core operating margin to the upper end of its prior forecast of 40-80 bps improvement. </p>
        <p>The oil &amp; gas sector of the FTSE All-Share weakened in February, falling 5.8%. Negative returns were experienced by selection of the Fund’s oil &amp; gas exploration and production companies and industrial engineers with energy sector exposure. </p>
        <p>Wood Group (-9.8%) saw a 16% contraction in revenue and 28% fall in operating profit in 2016 as activity levels remained subdued. Although oil prices have recovered some ground, the company still struck a very cautious tone with its outlook comments. It expects the oil &amp; gas market to continue to present challenges in 2017, with only modest recovery anticipated in selected areas. Although 2016 PBT for engineer Weir Group (-6.1%) was also heavily affected by the prolonged oil &amp; gas market downturn, falling 31% in constant currency terms to £170m, it was willing to be more upbeat regarding the outlook. It stated that order growth in Q4 grew 10% as oil &amp; gas and mining markets recovered. Management commented that recent signs in these core markets point to a cyclical upturn. While the 2016 numbers were broadly in-line and the tone of the statement was generally upbeat, shares in Weir Group had already recovered significantly in 2016 to reflect hopes of an inflexion point in demand, and gave back some ground in February.</p>
        <p>Actuator manufacturer Rotork (-3.3%) was another to suffer an expected fall in 2016 sales and profits as a result of unavoidable demand headwinds in key industries such as energy. The company commented that the trading environment saw some stabilisation in the second half of the year, but it expects near term energy market growth to be modest. As such, its main focus this year will be on keeping a tight control on costs.</p>
        <p>Patent translation specialist RWS Holdings (-4.2%) announced a US$85m acquisition of LUZ, a life sciences language services company based in San Francisco. The deal builds on last year’s move into the life sciences sector via the acquisition of CTi. The consideration for the LUZ purchase was part financed through a share placing to raise £40m. The shares were placed at 330p, a small discount to the prevailing share price. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included:</strong></p>
        <p>Unilever (+19.3%), AstraZeneca (+14.5%), Next Fifteen Communications (+12.0%), Shire (+10.8%) and Savills (+10.4%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p>Wood Group (-9.8%), Statpro (-6.3%), Weir Group (-6.1%), RWS Holdings (-4.2%) and Rotork (-3.3%).</p>

        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust GF Special Situations Fund returned 1.4%* in July compared with the 1.2% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></p>
        <p>July was a broadly positive month for UK equities. The mid and small cap end of the market once again outperformed large caps with the FTSE 250 and FTSE Small Cap indices returning 2.4% and 2.2% respectively, compared to the FTSE 100 Index&rsquo;s 0.9% return. The blue-chip index&rsquo;s returns were held back by an appreciation in the pound versus the dollar, as the greenback resumed its recent declines due to reduced confidence in President Trump&rsquo;s ability to implement his reflationary policies and soft US macro data. This in turn weighed on the FTSE 100&rsquo;s dollar earning constituents. </p>
        <p>Oil prices rebounded from recent weakness, helping the FTSE All-Share&rsquo;s oil &amp; gas sector deliver a total return of 3.2%. Moreover, improvements in metal prices &ndash; copper prices reaching two year highs and iron ore prices touching three month highs &ndash; drove gains in the materials sector (+11.2%). We hold no stocks in the materials sector, meaning we missed out on this rally. However, we maintain our avoidance of the sector because in our view miners&rsquo; values are derived from tangible assets (minerals in the ground x market price), not the intangible assets which our investment process seeks out.</p>
        <p>The health care sector was one of the notable fallers in the FTSE All-Share in July declining 5.8%. Much of this weakness was attributable to one of the Fund&rsquo;s holdings <strong>AstraZenca</strong> (-11.0%) after its Imfinzi drug failed to meet the primary endpoint for progression-free survival. </p>
        <p>On a more positive note, <strong>Bango </strong>(+33.7%) produced the biggest return of the Fund&rsquo;s holdings in July. The mobile payments company&rsquo;s stated in a trading update that its costs and revenue were in line with management expectations for the first half of 2017. It added that its end user spend rate exceeded &pound;300m per year at the end of June, compared to &pound;195m per year at the end of December 2016. </p>
        <p><strong>Renishaw&rsquo;s </strong>(+15.2%) final results were well received by the market. The company, which provides precision enhancing products to medical diagnostics, machine calibration and neurosurgery markets, reported record revenue of &pound;537m for the year to end June, up 26% from the same time last year. Adjusted pre-tax profit rose 25% and its total dividend was raised by 8% to 52p. Sir David McMurtry, chairman and CEO of the company, said he expects another year of growth despite Brexit uncertainties. </p>
        <p>Drinks giant <strong>Diageo&rsquo;s</strong> (+7.9%) shares appreciated after its full-year results were released at the end of July. It reported a 15% annual rise in net sales and 25% increase in underlying operating profit for the year to end of June. The company&rsquo;s board also approved a &pound;1.5bn share buyback and raised its total dividend by 5%.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, investment management company <strong>Brooks MacDonald </strong>(-14.8%) fell after newly installed CEO Catherine Connellan announced the company was set to see increasing costs due to upcoming additional regulation, to the detriment of margins, as well as unhelpfully revealing a &pound;6.5m charge related to legacy matters from its former Channel Islands-based Spearpoint business. On the positive side, the group noted that its capital position remains strong as it recording a 26% annual rise in funds under management at the end of June. </p>
        <p><strong>Domino&rsquo;s Pizza Group&rsquo;s </strong>(-9.4%) interim results showed a 9.1% underlying year-on-year increase in pre-tax profit as revenue rose by 20%. However, the market was disappointed by UK like-for-like sales growth of 2.4% in the 26 weeks to 25 June. This was down sharply from the 13.0% growth seen in the same period the year before. </p>
        <p>There was only one change to the Fund&rsquo;s holdings in July, with <strong>Sanne Group</strong> being sold. Management&rsquo;s holding in the company fell below our required threshold of 3% and was therefore sold from the Fund. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p>Bango (+33.7%), Smart Metering Systems (+15.9%), Renishaw (+15.2%), RWS Holding (+11.4%) and Diageo (+7.9%).</p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors included:</strong></p>
        <p>Brooks MacDonald (-14.8%), AstraZeneca (-11.0%), YouGov (-10.1%), Domino&rsquo;s Pizza Group (-9.4%) and Aggreko (-7.8%).</p>

The issue of units/shares in Liontrust Funds may be subject to an initial charge, which will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term.

        <p> </p>
        <p> &bull; Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</p>

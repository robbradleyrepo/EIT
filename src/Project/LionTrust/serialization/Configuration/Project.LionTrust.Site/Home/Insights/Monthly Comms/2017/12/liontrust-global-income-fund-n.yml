        <p><strong>The Fund returned -1.0%* in sterling terms in November compared with the flat average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</strong></p>
        <p>The MSCI World Index rose 0.2% in sterling terms in November. The Fund lagged the return of the index as US equities, an area which we are underweight, continued to reach new record highs, this time driven by renewed optimism over President Trump&rsquo;s tax reform efforts. The Fund&rsquo;s performance was therefore more in line with the MSCI World ex US Index, which returned -0.9% in the month.</p>
        <p>The month started off with a flurry of central bank updates, with the Bank of England raising rates for the first time in over a decade to 0.5%, while US President Donald Trump announced that Jerome Powell will be the next Federal Reserve chair. There were also some complications with Germany&rsquo;s leadership as coalition talks between Angela Merkel&rsquo;s CDU party and the Free Democrats broke down, keeping investors on their toes.</p>
        <p>There were no overarching sector trends this month, with consumer staples (+1.9%), telecoms (+1.9%) and consumer discretionary (+1.6%) the best performing sectors in the MSCI World Index. The worst performing sectors were materials (-1.0%), IT (-0.6%) and energy (-0.1%).</p>
        <p>Within the Fund, <strong>Big 5 Sporting Goods </strong>(+19.1%) participated in the consumer sector rally this month. Investors also digested the sporting goods retailer&rsquo;s third quarter results, which it released on the final day of October. </p>
        <p><strong>Deutsche Pfandbriefbank </strong>(+5.2%) was another gainer after it raised its 2017 pre-tax profit guidance for a second time. It now expects profit of between &euro;195m-&euro;200m compared to its previous estimate of &euro;150m-&euro;170m at the interim stage. This came on the back of strong numbers for the third quarter of the year, with pre-tax profit of &euro;51m compared to &euro;27m in the same quarter last year. The bank said the performance was driven by positive developments in net interest margin and commission income. </p>
        <p>Nordic construction and engineering group <strong>Peab </strong>(-9.0%) was one of the biggest fallers. It reported net sales of SEK11.6bn, which was just short of the consensus estimate of SEK11.7bn, though profit before tax came in slightly ahead. Management maintained a positive outlook, referencing a solid order backlog and a good project mix. However, they warned of challenges including capacity limitations, increases in subcontractor costs and rising land prices.</p>
        <p><strong><span>Giordano International </span></strong><span>(-7.2%) also reported third quarter earnings. The Hong Kong-listed apparel retailer recorded a 3.6% year-on-year rise in sales, while gross profit increased by 3.0%. However, the company&rsquo;s gross profit margin remained flat at 59.2% despite management guidance of further improvement. Tyre manufacturer <strong>Nokian Renkaat </strong>(-6.6%) fell despite publishing strong third quarter numbers. The company&rsquo;s operating profit increased by 21% and net sales up 15%, both beating the market&rsquo;s expectations.</span></p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Big 5 Sporting Goods (+19.1%), GWA Group (+9.2%) and RMB Holdings (+8.6%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Peab (-9.0%), Giordano International (-7.2%) and Nokian Renkaat (-6.6%).</p>

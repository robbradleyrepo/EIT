        <b>For investment professionals only<br><br>
        The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned 1.6%* in November. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap excluding investment trusts Index returned 0.3%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned -0.3% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was -0.6%.</b><br><br>
        November was once again dominated by politics as investors grappled with the fall-out from the unexpected Trump victory in the US election and the potential implications for sectors, bond prices, currencies and global stability. The smaller UK indices tend to display lower volatility at times like these, given the idiosyncratic make-up of their constituents and absence of ETFs, and this time was no different. The FTSE moved 3.2% peak-to-trough on the day following the announcement, versus 1.7% for FTSE AIM All-Share and just 1.1% for the FTSE Small Cap Index.<br><br>Closer to home, the UK’s new Chancellor was in action for the first time. A potential loser from Mr Hammond’s Autumn Statement was Belvoir Lettings (-31.7%), the UK’s largest franchised lettings agency, following the announcement of a ban on all fees levied by letting agencies on tenants in the UK. In response, the company released a statement outlining that it expects gross profit to fall by no more than 8% as a result of the move. Based upon Belvoir’s experience of a similar decision in Scotland in 2012, the company added that “mitigating action should be possible over time” and noted that it had lost no franchisees in Scotland as a result. The decision may also serve to strengthen Belvoir’s competitive position in its market, as the impact is likely to be greater on smaller local agents who do not enjoy the economies of scale afforded by the Belvoir franchise.<br><br>Overall, the Fund’s returns continue to be driven largely by bottom-up stock specific news rather than top-down macro-economic or political events.<br><br>
        November’s stock performance was topped by spend control and procurement software specialist Proactis (+20.5%), which enjoyed a strong rise after announcing a deal to acquire Millstream Associates for £15.5m. The acquisition had strong strategic rationale, with Millstream broadening the product offering, adding supply-side expertise, further expanding the customer base and creating “significant” cross-sell opportunities as well as enhancing earnings to the tune of 10% for the current year.<br><br>
        Focusrite (+15.8%) makes audio and recording equipment used by hobbyists and professional musicians alike. The company reported on a strong year to end August (its second as a listed company), with revenues up 13% and profits up 9.9% over the previous year, beating market forecasts. This was accompanied by an 8.3% hike in its dividend, upgrades for 2017 and an upbeat outlook statement highlighting “positive momentum which has continued in the period since the year end”.<br><br>
        Software provider to the social housing sector, Castleton Technology (-8.4%), fell despite announcing in-line interim numbers to September, as investors inferred a weak organic growth rate from the acquisitive company. With over 60% recurring revenue and welcome evidence of stronger cash generation than at the previous year end, there were some reasons to remain cheerful. However, following a spate of acquisitions and some related growing pains, there is work left to do by Castleton’s new CEO on integration and focusing the group on future growth.<br><br>Jaywing (+16.7%) recovered recent share price weakness during the month as it also released interim results to September. The data science-driven marketing agency confirmed that it expects full year results to be in line with previous guidance, as it reported 7% organic gross profit growth for the half year, driven by its Media and Analytics division, which is involved in search marketing and data analytics.<br><br>
        As usual, company trading statements explained some other moves during the month: enterprise resource software provider K3 Business Technology (-12.8%) drifted having reminded the market of the importance of its upcoming busy December trading period, while Instem (-27.7%), a supplier of applications and services to the early development healthcare market, fell after news that woes in the Instem Clinical division are ongoing. Earlier in the year, growth in other divisions had been enough to compensate for the slowdown. Although this momentum continues, some contract delays now mean Instem expects numbers to come in below market expectations, though its outlook for next year remains “encouraging”. Meanwhile, Crimson Tide (-12%), the mobile data solutions provider, fell without a clear catalyst.<br><br>
        Better news came from Keywords Studios (+17.9%) the video game services business, which forecast early in the month that both revenues and profits for the full year are to be “significantly ahead” of current market expectations. The performance is being driven by recently acquired localisation and audio business Synthesis. Keywords Studios remains a keen consolidator within the fragmented sector and later in the month received a further boost, announcing a deal to acquire Enzyme Testing (a Canadian functional and localisation testing specialist) for CAD$5.4m, which led its house broker to boost 2017 forecasts by 5%. Another strong performer was Quixant (+17%), which reported that profit will be ahead of market expectations for the year to December, thanks to increased demand from several customers for its gaming industry computer platforms.<br><br><b>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Risk markets generally performed well in September, but risk–free assets less so. Yields rose initially as the Turkish central bank raised interest rates. The move, designed to defend a plunging Lira, challenged the orthodox view that President Erdogan was controlling monetary policy. This move put a floor under the emerging market sell off that we had seen over the summer months. Although many problems remain for emerging markets, in the short term a combination of modestly improved sentiment and materially improved value pushed prices higher. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>A second feature for markets to dwell on was Italy. For most of the month the consensus view was that a budget deal would be struck incurring a deficit of less than 2% of GDP. Naturally this also gave a fillip to risk, especially anything of a ‘peripheral’ nature. Italian government bond yields fell in absolute terms and relative to core sovereign bonds. Indeed core debt – bunds, gilts and treasuries – had performed poorly for most of the month. Strong data and a desire for risk assets reduced the attractiveness of so called risk-free assets. However all that changed as the month drew to a close. Despite continued strong economic numbers, all eyes turned once more to Italy. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>News that the 2019 deficit target would be 2.4%, with similarly large numbers in 2020 and 2021, spooked investors. Italian yields rose well above 3%. The flight to quality that followed in the immediate aftermath clearly favoured the risk-free trade. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Rates<br><br></span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>The Fund’s duration was marginally lengthened as value improved. The Fund’s factor-adjusted underlying duration</span><sup><span>†</span></sup><span> moved to 3.2 years</span><span>*</span><span> (4.1 years unadjusted) with an additional 0.2 years added on the first day of October. This leaves the Fund closer to, but still below, our 4.5 years midpoint and a long way from the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index duration of 7.0 years.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>US yields moved above 3%, a level we see as offering a degree of protection for investors if not quite ’fair value’. We added to our position in US markets and, after a little bit of volatility, funded this by further reducing our exposure to German debt. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>For several months the spread between 5 year US and German debt has hovered around 3%. As we move closer to an end to European quantitative easing we expect that differential to narrow. Of course the US continues to increase interest rates and we expect a further hike in December. However, this is well established in the market and it is instructive that we have had two hikes now since the year-to-date high in US treasury yields in early summer. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>We took profit on half our position in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) – the breakeven moving from 195bps to 205bps. Otherwise, positions are little changed. We remain short Canadian and French debt relative to US and Norway – the former is a pure value play, the latter a ‘hedge’ against Italy. We continue to be positioned for a relative rally in US Treasuries compared with euro market debt. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Allocation</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span><br>We continued to sell credit into the summer rally. The fund ended with a 10% ‘short’ position to the high yield derivative market. In net terms this reduced our 20% physical stock to a 10% one. Clearly this is below the average weight to high yield. We continue to like the asset class long term, however for now we are happy to be a little underweight until we are better able to assess the outcome of the Italian situation. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>We also top-sliced some investment grade positions. Perhaps more pertinently, we didn’t participate in many of the new offers that came to market. In some cases we didn’t like the names, in many though there simply was not enough value to warrant committing new cash. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Regarding emerging markets, we remained on the side lines and zero weighted. We were of the opinion that prices had fallen too far, too fast (even against our expectation!) and with the probability of a rate hike to cheer Turkish markets, the chance of a rally was significant. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>We continue to prefer to play risk through high yield and investment grade hard currency debt. If, as expected, we see a slightly elevated level of volatility during October, we are likely to add back some investment grade or high yield. In a perfect world we see a continued rally in emerging markets and a short-term sell off in high yield that would lead us to short emerging markets and reduce the size of our high yield derivative short. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span><br>It was a pretty dull month for our holdings. All the action, most of it negative, happened in stuff we didn’t own. It would be easy to focus on bricks and mortar retailers where companies continue to struggle, but perhaps one of the highest profile ‘hits’ was Thomas Cook. Although demand held up reasonably well, it appeared that a poor fuel hedging policy caught them out. This specific issue exacerbated a generic one.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Higher commodity prices are generally inflationary; historically companies have been able to pass on price hikes to the consumer. However in recent years margins have taken the hit, one of the expenses that companies have been happier to offset by cheap debt. As the price of debt increases as monetary policy tightens, unless corporates are able to pass on some of that cost to the consumer, margins may be further squeezed and in extremis balance sheets threatened. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>In the Liontrust Strategic Bond Fund we own a subset of bonds from our Liontrust GF High Yield Bond Fund. We continue to run that fund very defensively, concentrating on higher quality balance sheets. One of the rare exceptions is our small holding in Enquest – its bonds have performed well as the oil price rises, however news of a rights issue to consolidate North Sea oil assets in its portfolio was an idiosyncratic positive. </span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><sup><span><br>† </span></sup><em><span>Adjusted underlying duration is based on the correlation of the instruments as opposed to just the mathematical weighted average of cash flows.&nbsp; High yield companies' bonds exhibit less duration sensitivity as the credit risk has a bigger proportion of the total yield; the lower the credit quality the less rate-sensitive the bond.&nbsp; Additionally, some subordinated financials also have low duration correlations and the bonds trade on a cash price rather than spread.&nbsp;</span></em></p>

        Key Risks&nbsp;<br>
        </strong><br>
        Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.<br>

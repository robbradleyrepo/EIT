        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bought – DGB Financial</strong>. A holding company largely comprising a bank, based in the South East of Korea. It avoids many of the risks of household exposure by having 70% exposure to corporate loans. It is relatively conservative, with a high (and rising) core deposit rate of 38% (bigger than the national banks) which gives it a lower cost of funding. Loan growth at the moment is hitting a normalised 8% for the year, and the company is both increasing its payout ratio and growing its earnings.</li>
            <li><strong>Sold</strong> <strong>– Jiagnan. </strong>Sub-quality supplies of cable by one of its competitors has led to tightening quality standards and rejection rates for the whole industry, an issue which is likely to persist for several months and reduce margins. Also, increased grid spending in rural areas in the near term will negatively impact product mix. As such, profits are likely to fall which will increase the risk for dividends as well.</li>

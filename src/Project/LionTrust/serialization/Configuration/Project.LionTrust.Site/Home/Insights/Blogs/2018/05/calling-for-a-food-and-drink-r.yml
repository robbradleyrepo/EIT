But as summer comes and people focus on getting fitter and healthier, we had a stark reminder this week of how far we have to go and the potential profits available for companies that can help get us there.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="Body" style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="Body" style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>New research has revealed that less than a third of the products from leading food and drinks companies can currently be classified as &lsquo;healthy&rsquo;</span><span>.</span><span></span><span>T</span>he<span>&nbsp;Access to Nutrition Foundation&rsquo;s 2018 Index measures the efforts of the world&rsquo;s largest food and beverage manufacturers to reduce ill health due to poor diets. This work covers 22 companies that generate an estimated US$500 billion in annual sales, whose products play a vital role in the diets of millions of people.</span></p>
        <p class="Body" style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="Body" style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 14px; text-align: left;"><span>While the Index shows these businesses have stepped up their efforts in this area, analysis of more than 23,000 products reveals less than a third of these meet the Foundation&rsquo;</span>s&nbsp;<span>&lsquo;healthy&rsquo; criteria. The group has therefore called on the food and drink industry to improve the nutritional quality of its wares, particularly established, high sales volume items, as well as setting measurable targets to reduce levels of salt and sugar for example.</span></p>
        <p class="Body" style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>People are demanding more of the good and less of the bad from food and drink and we believe the theme of&nbsp;<em>Delivering healthier foods&nbsp;</em>represents a significant investment opportunity. Across our Liontrust Sustainable Future funds, we continue to focus on companies meeting these demands.</span></p>

        <p class="Body" style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Wessanen for example is one of the leading sustainable food brands in Europe, manufacturing and distributing organic products such dairy alternatives, bread and biscuit replacements, vegetarian meals, breakfast cereals and hot drinks. The company&rsquo;s brands include Bjorg, Zonnatura, Clipper, Tartex, Bonneterre, Whole Earth, Kallo, Alter Eco, Allos, Gayelord Hauser and Isola Bio.</span></p>

        <p class="Body" style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>But we also need improvements across all the brands we know and love.&nbsp;Reformulation is key here as consumers demand&nbsp;healthier and more natural ingredients with the same taste and value for money. This balance is difficult to achieve, which makes the success of our long-term holding Kerry Group all the more impressive.</span></p>

        <p class="Body" style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 14px; text-align: left;"><span>This recent research</span><span></span><span>comes shortly after&nbsp;</span>h<span>ealth officials in the UK called for a 20% cut to calories in our food products by 2024. They estimated that meeting this target could prevent 35,000 premature deaths and around &pound;9 billion in healthcare and social care costs.</span></p>

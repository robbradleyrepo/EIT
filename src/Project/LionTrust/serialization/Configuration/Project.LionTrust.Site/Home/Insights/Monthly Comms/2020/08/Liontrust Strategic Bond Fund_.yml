        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust Strategic Bond Fund returned 2.2%* in sterling terms in July. The average return from the IA Sterling Strategic Bond sector, the Fund’s comparator benchmark, was 1.6%. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>Market backdrop<br /><br /></span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>As the backward-looking economic data covering the height of various countries’ lockdowns trickled out, we can see what we already know to be true – that activity levels fell by record amounts during the second quarter of 2020. The first release of Q2 2020 GDP in the US was -32.9% annualised, roughly four times the magnitude of the drop seen in Q4 2008 post Lehman Brothers’ default. As stated though, this data was always going to be dire and markets have, quite rightly, long since moved on to focussing on the recovery.</span></p>
        <p><span>The path of the recovery was never going to be V-shaped given the changed working practices required, the economic scars of the crisis and further Covid-19 infection flare-ups. Market sentiment continues to oscillate between positivity over the recovery and fears of second waves of Covid-19; the range within which risk assets now trades though has narrowed due to the ongoing market support from central bankers’ largesse.</span></p>
        <p><span>The US had to pause easing lockdown restrictions as significant outbreaks occurred in various sunshine states.&nbsp; These have passed their zenith and new cases are fortunately presently trending downwards. The poor handling of the crisis in the US has manifested itself in currency weakness; the US Dollar fell by 4.6% against the euro during July, the single biggest monthly fall since 2010. US Treasury yields touched record low levels but given the starting point of already ultra-low yields, this is more headline grabbing than an all-out bond rally. Once again, we emphasise that you need to be in the right part of the bond market to benefit from this as long-dated bonds outperformed their shorter-dated cousins e.g. 30-year yields fell 22 basis points compared to only a 9 basis points rally for 5-year yields; or, in bond jargon, July saw a bull flattener.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Sovereign bond markets will find it hard to sustain these yield levels with record amounts of supply from governments financing their budget deficits and as authorities get better at isolating localised virus hotspots.&nbsp; In a free market the metaphorical “bond vigilantes” might already be extracting more yield from profligate governments, but we operate in a financially repressed market driven by central banks. It will therefore be fascinating to see how the US Federal Reserve’s policy evolves at its September meeting when changes are expected. Rather than outright yield curve control, the Fed is likely to opt for some form of enhanced forward guidance; there could be a commitment to keep rates low until specific milestones have been met. The Fed will undoubtedly want to run the economy hot for a while to help close the output gap; what they may do is start targeting nominal GDP or even average inflation rates. This is supportive for short-dated bonds as base rates would remain anchored for longer than needed, but any longer tenors would be vulnerable to rising growth and inflation. So, we have money printing financing government debt and central banks aiming for higher inflation rates – it is no surprise that inflation breakevens have been doing well or, if I may comment ultra vires, that the gold price has hit a new record high.</span></p>
        <p><span><strong><span style="color: black;">Rates</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>If one only considered valuations, then the duration of the Fund would be zero. We do though have to respect the technicals of central bank buying so retain a low duration exposure and associated small correlation to sovereign bond markets.&nbsp; At the end of July, the Fund had 2.5 years</span><span><sup><span>†</span></sup></span><span> duration, with a strong preference for the US. Within our limited duration exposure, we have been positioned in the right places, namely longer-dated US Treasuries. Furthermore, the Fund also benefitted from having 0.5 years’ exposure to TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities).</span></p>
        <p><span><strong><span style="color: black;">Allocation</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>The Fund continues to be significantly exposed to credit having made a large asset allocation increase during the crisis. The combined weighting is approximately 80%, split between 56% investment grade and 24% high yield; note that 6% of the high yield exposure is through a CDS index overlay using iTraxx Xover. We have reduced iTraxx Xover exposure during the month, taking advantage of a strong market to book some profits.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p><span><strong><span style="color: black;">Selection</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>The continued credit spread rally was beneficial for the Fund during July. Performance at the stock selection level was very much incremental in nature with only a few standout performers during July. Subordinated <strong>Citigroup</strong> bonds were one of the larger gainers for the Fund during July and <strong>Origin Energy</strong>’s credit spreads continued their grind tighter.</span></p>
        <p><span>Profits were taken in <strong>Anheuser-Busch</strong>’s bonds as they had become fully valued and offered no more upside in our view. A new issue was purchased from <strong>Bayer</strong>, the German pharmaceutical and life sciences/agri-chemicals company. The Fund used to own exposure to Bayer but sold it when the company became embroiled in litigation inherited from their acquisition of Monsanto. Bayer has now agreed a settlement for the majority of claims; with this overhang of uncertainty greatly reduced we are comfortable investing in the name again and believe the new bonds offer value as other investors will follow suit.</span></p>

        <p><span style="color: #222222;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

      Hint: LegacyArticle_Content
      Value: |
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Fund outperformed its peer group over Q3, registering returns of 2.38% against the IA Mixed Investment 40-85% Shares sector average of 0.93%</strong><strong> *</strong><strong>. </strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Our process targets businesses that can grow structurally, driven by the shift towards a global economy that is more efficient, provides a higher quality of life and is more resilient.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Stock selection and asset allocation both contributed positively over the quarter, with stockpicking the key driver of outperformance, consistent with the Fund&rsquo;s process. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In terms of attribution, our decisions to overweight Global and UK equities, and underweight cash and government bonds, all had positive impacts. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In terms of individual stock drivers, ASML performed very well over the quarter. Its Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) technology dominates the market and is an important enabler of innovation within the semiconductor space. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Semiconductor companies compete on their ability to offer leading-edge technology into new end markets such as autos, the Internet of Things (IOT) and Artificial Intelligence. Many of these innovative chips help deliver a more efficient global economy, particularly where the use of scarce resources is concerned, and ASML benefits from this efficiency trend.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Elsewhere, Sophos was another strong performer as the growth in new business for its cyber security software became evident. Sophos &ndash; which benefits from our <em>Enhancing digital security</em> theme &ndash; sells to the SME market worldwide: cyber-attacks there may not attract the kind of headlines that recent assaults on WPP and Reckitt Benckiser received but are just as significant for the businesses in question. </p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">Worldpay, the electronic payment company, received a bid approach from Vantiv and we took profits by reducing our position post-announcement. The merged company will have greater scale in this area of structural growth: we continue to see more cashless transactions as it is more convenient and also reduces fraud.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">On the negative side, Acuity Brands was a poor performer in Q3. After improved returns over the second quarter, doubts emerged around the company&rsquo;s ability to continue its recent growth pattern. This is due to pressure at the low end of the LED market from Chinese competitors and the potential that LED penetration may be higher than previously thought. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">LED lighting is an exciting technology that can reduce the energy used in buildings and homes significantly and Acuity is a high-quality business that distributes these products. The issue is that, as penetration of LED increases, Acuity Brands will grow at the market rate rather than at a much higher rate. This in turn puts pressure on the company&rsquo;s valuation.</p>

        <p>&bull; Liontrust SF Absolute Growth Fund and Liontrust SF Global Growth Fund have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Liontrust SF Absolute Growth Fund invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and have a concentrated portfolio of securities. There is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund&rsquo;s share price.</p>

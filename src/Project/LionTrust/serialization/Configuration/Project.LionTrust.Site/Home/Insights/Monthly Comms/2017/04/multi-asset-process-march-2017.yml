        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p>The twin pillars of Brexit and Donald Trump continued to dominate newsflow and sentiment in March.</p>
        <p>In the UK, the government finally triggered Article 50 on 29 March but the full ramifications of that will only become clear over the coming months and years. For now, we can expect more uncertainty as the government attempts to untangle decades of regulation and re-establish its relationship with Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Controversy also raged on as Scotland sought authority for a second independence referendum, focusing on its future role in Europe.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Across the Atlantic, President Trump continued to settle into the White House but after markets have largely been ascending since his election, some of the shine came off in March on fears about delays to proposed tax cuts and other pro-growth policies. Investors have become increasingly concerned that Trump will struggle to get some of his policies through Congress and the debacle over his attempted repeal of Obamacare cast renewed doubt on what he will actually be able to achieve.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Meanwhile, the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch fund manager survey was released during the month, revealing a third of investors now consider equities overvalued – the highest reading in 17 years. Within this, 81% believe the US is currently the most overvalued market and higher interest rates came out as the most serious threat to the equity bull market.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">March saw the third hike in the Fed’s current tightening cycle, which began in December 2015. Additional rises were likely delayed by the election campaign, but now there has been some consensus forming around Trumpflation – despite the recent drop off – we have seen rate expectations pick up and markets are pricing in three further increases in 2017.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In Europe, elections continue to set the agenda and March saw the first of 2017’s many political flashpoints as Holland went to the polls. While incumbent centre-right VVD party beat populist anti-immigration candidate Geert Wilder’s eurosceptic PVV, it remains to be seen whether this marks a turning point in the growth of populism and the associated undercurrent of anti-euro feeling.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We are not ignoring politics – with France, and fears over a Le Pen victory, Germany and possibly Italy facing elections this year – but as so often happens, fear is masking a more positive fundamental outlook for Europe.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">As we said last month, we are moving from an era of belt tightening to loosening – from lower to higher growth, inflation and bond yields – but this more favourable environment needs to be translated into earnings and share prices.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Parts of the eurozone have stagnated for over a decade and European shares continue to trade at a significant discount to the US, but we believe a narrowing may be justified, with earnings gathering momentum, the economic surprise index trending upwards and analysts’ revisions to forecast earnings finally looking to have bottomed out.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Making any kind of predictions is fraught with danger in this new era of populism. But while macro twists and turns continue to cause havoc for short-term speculators, these events create opportunity for long-term patient investors and as ever, we stand poised to take advantage where markets look cheap.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><br></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Disclaimer:<o:p></o:p></b></p><p class="MsoNormal">• Past performance is not a guide to future performance. •

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>The Fund’s A5 share class returned 1.3%* in euro terms in May (A4 share class 1.2%). This compares with the 1.7% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index</span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Trade tensions between China and the US eased for most of May, before being sparked again by Trump’s decision late in the month to move ahead with tariffs on US$50bn of Chinese imports. The US also announced that the EU, Canada and Mexico would be subject to tariffs, once again raising the prospect of retaliatory action.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Momentum in oil prices continued with Brent oil surpassing US$80/barrel for the first time since 2014. The rise in May reflected a combination of Venezuela’s oil exports declining under the pressure of political and economic turmoil and the anticipation of Iranian crude sales slowing after the US withdrew from the nuclear deal. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Elsewhere, the market was captivated by developments in Italy. The country’s two leading parties looked close to forming a government before their candidate for finance minister was blocked by President Sergio Mattarella. This sparked concern that another election could be held where anti EU parties could gain even more power. Investors sold out of Italian debt and equities causing the Italian central bank to intervene and purchase bonds to stabilise the market. Calm was restored towards the end of the month, as a deal to form a government again looked likely. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>IT stocks were the top performers across European markets in May, the sector registering a 6.7% gain in euro terms. The materials (+4.5%) and energy (+3.5%) sectors also had a good month. Telecoms (-8.3%) and financials (-6.3%) were notable areas of weakness while utilities (-2.2%) also recorded a negative return. </span><span>The Fund has four holdings in the oil &amp; gas sector, all of which registered share price rises: <strong>Tethys Oil</strong> (+27.7%), <strong>Soco International</strong> (+7.3%), <strong>BW Offshore</strong> (+8.7%) and <strong>Hunting</strong> (+5.6%).</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Many of the Fund’s positions in the materials sector also performed well, including <strong>Evraz</strong> (+11.6%), <strong>Eramet</strong> (+5.8%) and <strong>ENCE Energia y Celulose</strong> (+5.0%). But <strong>Centamin</strong> (-21.1%), another of the Fund’s holdings in the sector, came under pressure after downgrading production guidance for its Sukari gold mine in Egypt. Due to lower grades from its open pit and reduced underground production (c.10% below forecast), Centamin is now expecting 2018 production of between 505,000 and 515,000 ounces – down from 580,000 ounces – at a cash cost of US$875 to US$890 – up from US$770.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>SimCorp</span></strong><span> (+14.9%) shares rallied on the back of a solid set of Q1 numbers and the maintenance of full-year forecasts. Q1 revenue increased 23% year-on-year, the result of organic expansion and the acquisition of SimCorp Italiana. Operating profit more than doubled. The provider of portfolio management software commented that 2018 forecasts are maintained at 10%-15% local currency revenue growth with an expectation of an operating profit margin between 24.5% and 27.5%. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Among the detractors, <strong>Oriflame</strong> (-23.3%) fell on outlook comments. The cosmetics retailer recorded an 8% sales increase in the first quarter of 2018, boosted by the timing of catalogues, but operating margins were squeezed by 40bps to 9.2% due to negative currency trends. The company commented that a notable slowdown in sales in Russia as well as a negative effect from the timing of catalogues and conferences were affecting the start of the second quarter. </span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The restructuring of the Fund’s portfolio of holdings continued as we implemented the results of our</span><span> annual review of companies’ report and accounts. This month’s changes saw </span><strong><span>BGEO Group</span></strong><span>, <strong>DFDS</strong>, <strong>SBanken</strong> and <strong>Software AG</strong> were removed. </span></p>

        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p>As was the case for a large part of 2016, the first month of the New Year was dominated by the twin pillars of Donald Trump and Brexit.</p>
        <p>Trump&rsquo;s inauguration was met with demonstrations around the world but amid all the marches and debates about crowd size, many markets have largely continued their recent ascent. The Dow Jones finally breached the 20,000 level late in the month, the first time it has done so since launch in 1896, although concerns about Trump&rsquo;s travel ban hit sentiment as January expired.</p>
        <p>Showing a similar pattern, the FTSE 100 hit an all-time peak beyond 7300 mid-month and remained above the record 7000 despite dropping off slightly in the second half.</p>
        <p>On the currency front, the dollar had a tough January as policy concerns outweighed the expectations of higher inflation that dominated the end of 2016. Demand for the currency soared after Trump&rsquo;s victory as many predicted positive economic and trade policies but little detail on this during his first days in office, followed by controversy surrounding the travel ban, have spooked markets.</p>
        <p>As expected in such an environment, gold enjoyed its strongest month since June 2016 when the Brexit vote sparked a similar rush for perceived safe haven assets. With Trump&rsquo;s travel ban &ndash; and the subsequent dismissal of an Attorney General unwilling to enforce it &ndash; investors are starting to understand the President may be serious about putting some of his more radical campaign pledges into action.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the UK, the Brexit saga rumbles on, with the Supreme Court dismissing the government's argument that it can begin official negotiations with the rest of the EU without Parliament's prior agreement. Parliament has now voted in favour of triggering Article 50 but we still have scant detail on the likelihood of a hard Brexit. Despite this uncertainty, figures released in January revealed the UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7 last year, putting pay to projections the leave vote would have an immediately detrimental impact on the economy.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Consumer spending was the key factor in this and Chancellor Philip Hammond said he believed there are signs the positive effect from sterling&rsquo;s depreciation is outweighing the negative expected to come from rising inflation.</p>
        <p>With such a heavy focus on the US, China has slipped off many radars but the start of the Year of the Rooster has moved the region into the headlines once again. Solid 6.8% growth in the fourth quarter seems to show a country continuing to rebalance its economy but upcoming leadership changes in the Communist Party may affect this as the year progresses.</p>
        <p>As with most countries around the world, it also remains to be seen how US-China relations might develop with Trump in the White House. China sends a large portion of its exports to the US so any threat of tariffs could have a serious impact on market volatility and performance </p>
        <p>Spiralling debt is also seen as a potential flashpoint for China, with government debt rising from 160% of GDP in 2005 to 277% at the end of 2016 and the private sector debt ratio at an historic peak of 209%. This has led to many market watchers warning China&rsquo;s growth will slow in the coming years: ratings agency Fitch Ratings for example expects GDP growth will fall back to 6.4% this year and 5.7% in 2018</p>
        <p>Elsewhere around the world, Europe could be facing a volatile 2017 as a range of countries go to the election polls. In the coming few months, the Netherlands has legislative elections in March, France faces presidential and legislative elections in summer and Germany has its Federal elections in August and October. Given the surprises of 2016, few would feel comfortable attempting to predict the result of any of these but any lurches towards populism will surely cast further doubt on the future of the EU project and potentially destabilise an already fragile economy.</p>
        <p>Overall, policy divergence continues to develop as globalism &ndash; at least for now &ndash; gives way to greater populism and while the US has started on a rate hiking path, Europe and Japan&rsquo;s monetary policy remains accommodative. Market participants look to be expecting higher growth, higher inflation and higher bond yields. Stronger economic growth favours portfolios skewed towards higher yield and shorter duration assets and we believe an end to quantitative easing around the world signals a return to &lsquo;old school&rsquo; investing focusing on fundamentals and valuations.</p>

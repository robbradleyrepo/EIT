      Value: With no action from the Federal Reserve overnight, commentators are suggesting it might be behind the curve and starting to take a risk with inflation. David Roberts considers early market reaction to the Fed’s hold.

        <p><span>The US </span><span>Fed</span><span>eral Reserve</span><span> left </span><span>interest </span><span>rates unchanged overnight and the jury was out as to whether </span><span>its</span><span> accompanying comments were hawkish or dovish. </span></p>
        <p><span>It is </span><span>often better to look at market reaction rather than the comments of strategists and economists. To that end, risk markets had been softening in the run up to the </span><span>Fed meeting. A combination of d</span><span>ollar strength, renewed trade war concerns and fears of further US sanctions against Iran pushed </span><span>Emerging M</span><span>arkets </span><span>(EM) </span><span>lower &ndash; equity markets generally fell and the cost of protecting against EM sovereign default</span><span>s</span><span> rose. </span></p>
        <p><span>It is possible to suggest the Fed is in dang</span><span>er of moving &ldquo;behind the curve&rdquo; and starting to take a risk with inflation.</span><span> That is, on some measures</span><span>,</span><span> interest rates may need to rise quite rapidly to prevent the economy ove</span><span>rheating: w</span><span>age pressure in particular is rising. </span></p>
        <p><span>A</span><span> benign Fed is </span><span>normally good for equity markets: </span><span>in the very short term</span><span>,</span><span> growth</span><span> and inflation may be supported;</span><span> longer term</span><span> however,</span><span> more interest rate hikes than anticipated may be needed to curb current excesses. </span></p>
        <p><span>So far though</span><span>,</span><span> this seems to be an </span><span>Emerging Markets problem</span><span>. We always forget, (or choose not to remember) that EM economies are</span><span>,</span><span> in the round</span><span>,</span><span> heavily dependent on cheap, sustainable funding to permit excess growth and justify expanding earnings multiples</span><span>. EMs should lead cyclical rotation but, </span><span>of course</span><span>,</span><span> historically they lag. </span></p>
        <p><span>Core</span><span> bond yields are little changed and I woul</span><span>d argue </span><span>that </span><span>if the market really does believe the Fed is acting too slowly</span><span>,</span><span> then we will see all yields move a little higher in the next few days. One thing we definitely need to watch for i</span><span>s the possibility the US curve steepens</span><span> &ndash; that is long</span><span>-</span><span>dated bonds fall to a gr</span><span>eater extent than short ones. </span></p>
        <p><span>If</span><span> that happens, that is a danger signal for risk markets &ndash; I have said many times that once the US curve stops flattening</span><span>,</span><span> we normally have around </span><span>six</span><span> months before risk assets properly roll over. </span></p>
        <p><span>We started the week with a negative position in Emerging Ma</span><span>rkets &ndash; a 5% index level short &ndash; and t</span><span>hat is working nicely. Against that</span><span>,</span><span> we have some core </span><span>developed market (DM)</span><span> high</span><span>-</span><span>yield assets and these are looking </span><span>solid for now. If anything, I would</span><span> increase the EM short in favour of DM, not least </span><span>on</span><span> a&nbsp;valuation basis. </span></p>
        <p><span>We also have been adding a l</span><span>ittle to US interest rate risk, as y</span><span>ields </span><span>at </span><span>around 3%, even with the Fed a little behind the curve</span><span>,</span><span> offer</span><span> </span><span>a nice degree of protection. US bonds are also blindingly cheap relative to other markets. </span></p>
        <p><span>We are now marginally </span><span>long</span><span> US bonds on most measures although short almost</span><span> everything else &ndash; giving us a beta</span><span> of about 0.7 compared with the global bond market. </span></p>
        <p><span>To sum up then, we are </span><span>short EM, long DM high</span><span>-</span><span>yield risk and long core US bonds, </span><span>and </span><span>short most everything else.</span><strong><span> </span></strong><span>R</span><span>emaining short EM and expecting ot</span><span>her DM sovereign bonds to fall </span><span>relative to Treasuries clearly makes sense. </span></p>
        <span>If</span><span> </span><span>we return to the old normal of </span><span>nominal growth, bond yields</span><span> and real returns all around 4%,</span><span> then my predicted 3.5% high for 10</span><span>-</span><span>year bonds may be a little low</span><span>.</span>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust GF Strategic Bond Fund returned 0.0%* in US dollar terms in September. For comparison</span></strong><strong><span> </span></strong><strong><span>the average return from the EAA Fund Global Flexible Bond USD Hedged peer group was 0.1%. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Market backdrop</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>August saw many bond markets move to new record low yields and the very early part of September continued that move despite reasonable economic data. However, the rally quickly ran out of steam and the first half of the month saw one of the biggest sell-offs for the global bond market in recent years.</span></p>
        <p><span>Just when some had started to focus on a possible extended bear market, we had the attack on Saudi oil facilities. Although inflationary &ndash; oil jumped nearly 20% at one stage &ndash; the attacks prompted a flight to quality. Bond yields fell again and buying continued through to month end.</span></p>
        <p><span>Overall, most core yields ended higher over the period although the dispersion of return was sizeable: Italy again the best performer where yields dropped around 15 basis points, compared with the US where yields rose about 20 basis points on ten year bonds.</span></p>
        <p><span>Dispersion of return has been a feature of markets this year. Although we talk about market manipulation and quantitative easing reducing volatility, underneath the headline figure moves in yields have been large &ndash; at least by the historic standards of the bond market!</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Rates</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>A mixed bag. We didn&rsquo;t have much rates beta, which was beneficial in a modest yield rising environment. However, our main position in US bonds (conventional and index linked) underperformed UK and European markets. This was reflected in the Fund&rsquo;s performance against most major competitors and certainly against global indices &ndash; it was more resilient to the drawdowns early in the month compared to others, but it did lag the subsequent leap higher. We added duration risk in the sell off. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We maintained a big curve position in Germany (owning 10 year bonds, shorting 5 year ones) &ndash; I&rsquo;ve written about this </span><a href="/what-we-think/blogs/Ten-trades-to-put-a-spring-in-your-step"><span style="color: #0bb14d;">elsewhere</span></a><span>: we were right for the wrong reasons and being lucky rather than clever added value for clients. Mario Draghi&rsquo;s suggestion that interest rates had to give way to fiscal policy led to a general bear flattener which worked really well for us. I&rsquo;d expected a bull flattener, anticipating more dovish comments from the ECB. However,</span><span> Draghi&rsquo;s less than subtle indication about the impotence of further monetary loosening was echoed by his colleagues at the Fed and Bank of Japan and gives us hope that the mad, Frankenstein monstrous experiment that is QE could finally come to an end.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Allocation</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>It was a rollercoaster for credit too in September. We remained underweight &ndash; around 10% in high yield and 35% investment grade. Most of the Fund&rsquo;s exposure was in the US where spreads firmed. In contrast European markets drifted a little, particularly in the UK where the return of the &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; spectre didn&rsquo;t inspire bond buyers with confidence. We continue to view credit as modestly overvalued. If running a closed end fund we&rsquo;d be quiet happy with a big overweight and clip the income. However, in the world of open ended investment we prefer to wait and see how the political flash points develop before committing client capital for the long term.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Another quiet month. Supply did start to pick up materially toward the end of the period but we&rsquo;d see October as the peak. Many of the new deals carried too much risk for too little reward and we tended not to participate in new issues. We did add UK life insurer <strong>Rothesay</strong> to the Fund &ndash; a name we have known since its foundation. We added exposure to <strong>Netflix</strong>, a long-time favourite, as bonds weakened in the secondary market. We look forward to more opportunity at more realistic prices through the autumn &ndash; we have plenty of firepower to add, but still don&rsquo;t feel pressed to do so. </span></p>

        <p style="color: #222222; margin: 0px 0px 14px;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.<br />

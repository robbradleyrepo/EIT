        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust Strategic Bond Fund returned 1.5%* in sterling terms in June. The average return from the IA Sterling Strategic Bond sector, the Fund’s comparator benchmark, was 1.5%. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>Market backdrop<br />
        <br />
        </span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Economic data around large swathes of the world vastly improved as countries relaxed their lockdown restrictions. We continue to emphasise the recovery will not be V-shaped in nature; it is sharp simply because of the extent of the downturn, but the right-hand side of the V will not reach as high. It will not be until the end of 2021, or 6-12 months after a vaccine, that real GDP is likely to reach levels on a par with the end of 2019.</span></p>
        <p><span>Financial markets have been oscillating between improving economic data, including the 7.5m jobs recovered in the US so far, and the risk of a second wave of the virus. Many southern US states have now had to pause or even reverse the easing of restrictions; personally, I would argue that this is not a second wave per se, but rather the failure to deal properly with the first wave of infections. Worldwide, one has to expect more localised flare ups, but hopefully these will remain well contained.</span></p>
        <p><span>The one certainty we do have for the foreseeable future is loose monetary policy. Central bankers have been clear that they will be more tolerant of inflation, running economies “hot” for a while in order to try to heal the economic scars of the crisis. The Federal Reserve’s dot plot of members’ rates expectations shows a holding pattern until at least the end of 2022. Over the next few months expect further forward guidance from the Fed and probably implicit yield curve control rather than the more explicit yield targeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia.</span></p>
        <p><span>The anchoring of short-term rates has meaningful ramifications for sovereign bond markets.&nbsp; Volatility in shorter dated bonds has drastically reduced, the curve pivots in the 5 to 7-year maturity vicinity and becomes more sensitive to economic data and risk sentiment. The next few years will see an interesting battle between bondholders wanting more yield, to fund the necessary record levels of supply which finances fiscal deficits, and monetary authorities trying to keep policy highly stimulative. Certainly, financial repression is alive and kicking in the bond markets today.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Looking ahead to the second half of 2020, one hopes there will be a little less of a rollercoaster ride and that fewer lives will be lost to Covid19. We begin each following section with a summary of our views for the remainder of the year.</span></p>
        <p><span><strong><span>Rates</span></strong></span></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span>Valuation: Ridiculously expensive. Our process argues for a duration close to zero, based on the likelihood of negative real returns in coming years for holders of G7 sovereign debt. Geographically, US bonds still look cheap relative to European and Asia on a historic basis. As policy rates converge this reduces the cost of carry for European investors in US bonds.</span></li>
            <li><span>Fundamentals &amp; Technicals<strong>: </strong>Economic data will continue to be dire relative to 2019, providing support to rates markets. However, the main support comes not from investors but central banks’ unprecedented bond buying </span><span>at a time when massive fiscal stimulus sees record levels of supply threatening prices. </span><span>EU and Asian markets look to be on a better footing than the US which has clearly mishandled the virus lockdown. Offsetting that is fiscal stimulus and a kicker from lower Fed funds.</span></li>
            <li><span>Positioning: While ‘neutral’ Fund duration is 4.5 years, value alone dictates close to zero. However, aggressive technical support combined with economic uncertainty means we have remained between 2.5 and 3.0 years to offset risk of recent purchases in investment grade and high yield. Curve positions have become just directional bets as short ends won’t move (no scope to cut rates, no intention to raise). </span></li>
            <li><span>Potential returns: We expect core bonds to lose value for investors under most scenarios. Starting with negative income does not help of course. Our focus is on the US where potential returns are low but look better than German or French government bonds.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In June we t</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">ook advantage of volatility to eke out a little extra performance by exploiting trading ranges in US 30-year and UK 10-year debt; the overall Fund duration was kept within the bounds of 2.5 to 3 years</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><sup>†</sup></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">. As part of overall risk management we instigated a 5s10s flattener in Germany, the 10-year tenor having room to rally during periods of risk-off sentiment. Profits were taken on our long France versus Germany position after the spread between the two converged due to increased signs of European cohesion.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>We trimmed some exposure to US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) as they continued to outperform their conventional cousins; in the bond market lexicon, inflation breakevens widened during the month. The Fund retains 0.5 years’ exposure as we believe that more of an inflation premium is required by markets, if a dip in economic activity over the next few months causes breakevens to lag we would increase the size of the position again.</span></p>
        <p><span><strong><span>Allocation</span></strong></span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Valuation: Sovereign debt looks expensive. While investment grade and high yield had their best quarters in a decade, they are still pricing a recession so purely on value we should be overweight</span></li>
            <li><span>Fundamentals &amp; Technicals<strong>: </strong>Fundamentals look better than a month ago for credit; not so much for rates. That comparison is easy, and the real test lies in sustainability of “reopening”. However, technical support from the Fed and ECB has hardly started and it is possible to see a decoupling of credit and equity should recovery fail to be sustained.</span></li>
            <li><span>Positioning: We have taken some profit but remain above our neutral weights of 50% investment grade and 20% high yield.</span></li>
            <li><span>Potential returns: Spreads could tighten slightly which, in combination with income, makes for a strong return outlook relative to cash or core sovereign debt.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span></span>The Fund continues to be significantly exposed to credit having made a large asset allocation increase during the crisis. The combined weighting is approximately 85%, split between 58% investment grade and 27% high yield (note that 9% of the high yield exposure is through a CDS index overlay using iTraxx Xover). During June we used swings in sentiment to take some profits in Xover when its spread was below 350bps, then bought back the risk position just below 400bps.</p>
        <p><span><strong><span>Selection</span></strong></span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Valuation: High-quality, liquid bonds have recovered well. Lower-quality illiquid bonds have been rallying recently - is now the time to chase those?</span></li>
            <li><span>Fundamentals &amp; Technicals<strong>: </strong>We have a survivor bias, owning debt in companies that we believe will survive, that have sustainable business models and where the state and society can offer support.</span></li>
            <li><span>Positioning: We remain light or zero-weighted in energy, consumer discretionary, AT1, hybrid and CCC debt. We own what the Central Banks want to buy</span></li>
            <li><span>Potential returns: Decent returns are available if you select the right bonds, but losses can be substantial if you get it wrong.</span></li></ul>
        <p><span>Strong contributors to performance during June included <strong>Dell</strong>, <strong>British American Tobacco</strong> and <strong>Eli Lilly</strong>; the latter was trimmed at pretty much its tightest spread level since launch. We wrote last month about buying a cheap bond from <strong>Allianz</strong>; after its credit spread tightened 50 basis points, we banked the profits in June.</span></p>
        <p><span>Moving into the high yield arena, an existing holding in <strong>Virgin</strong> <strong>Media</strong> was switched into new issues as we wanted to retain exposure to this favoured issuer. A new name was purchased too: <strong>AMS</strong>, which is a sensors business borrowing money to acquire the majority of a peer. AMS is arguably over-exposed to Apple in its consumer business, whereas the acquired business is particularly exposed to the autos sector. We believe the clear diversification benefits provide industrial logic to this merger and the bonds offer a great yield and upside as the company will deleverage over time.</span></p>

Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust Special Situations Fund returned 1.4%* in April, compared with the -0.4% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></p>
        <p>Geopolitical tensions persisted in April with Donald Trump hinting at unilateral action against North Korea, which served to increase nervousness ahead of his meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping. However, the meeting largely passed off without incident and, despite North Korea&rsquo;s subsequent failed missile test, investors were comfortable driving equities to another month of gains: the MSCI World Index of developed markets returned 1.2% over the month in local currency terms. European stockmarkets were particularly buoyant following a first round result in the French presidential election which was seen as favourable &ndash; the second round will see a shoot-out between Le Pen and Macron in which the latter is strong favourite.</p>
        <p>Returns to UK investors were, however, affected by the strength of sterling over the month. Theresa May&rsquo;s opportunistic move to call a snap election seemed designed to exploit the perceived weakness of opposition parties. Investors reacted swiftly to price in the probability of the Conservatives securing a larger majority and a stronger mandate to implement Brexit on May&rsquo;s terms &ndash; seen to imply a more stable, &lsquo;softer&rsquo; exit. Sterling appreciated 1.6% in trade-weighted terms. This move weighed on the international earners found within the FTSE 100 Index, which registered a -1.3% total return for the month. Although the lower market cap echelons of the London market contain a number of exporters who are also influenced by sterling moves, the average company is more domestically-oriented than in the FTSE 100. The FTSE 250 Index (+3.8%), FTSE Small Cap Index (+2.1%) and FTSE AIM All-Share (+3.8%) all showed evidence of investor risk appetite.</p>
        <p>The Fund&rsquo;s substantial mid and small cap weighting was beneficial in this environment. Stocks including Mortgage Advice Bureau (+16.5), Spectris (+10.5%), Renishaw (+9.7%), RWS Holdings (+9.6%) were among the Fund&rsquo;s holdings to rally within a benign small and mid-cap environment in the absence of any significant news flow catalyst. In addition, a selection made gains following upbeat corporate releases. For example, Brooks Macdonald (+11.2%) rose throughout the month, reaching an all-time high on the back its 26 April announcement of quarterly assets under management. It saw a 6.5% increase to &pound;9.9bn over the quarter, with broadly equal contributions from fund inflows and positive investment performance.</p>
        <p>Shares in recruitment company Pagegroup (+16.9) jumped on the release of a Q1 trading update which revealed 9% year-on-year growth in gross profit in constant currency, and a 20% rise in reported terms as the company benefitted from sterling weakness. The quarterly gross profit of &pound;170m was the company&rsquo;s largest ever, and the growth rate represented an expansion from the 3.8% recorded in Q416. Although the Q1 numbers were artificially boosted by a late Easter (which fell in Q2 this year but Q1 last year), the results gave a more robust picture of underlying trading than had been expected. UK activity was broadly flat year-on-year (-0.1%) as Brexit uncertainty continued to weigh, but Pagegroup&rsquo;s key EMEA region &ndash; responsible for almost half the company&rsquo;s profits &ndash; saw a 28% rise, while Asia Pacific and Americas division grew by 19% and 34% respectively. </p>
        <p>Spirax-Sarco Engineering (+10.2%) was another mid-cap highlight. The company, which specialises in products which control the flow of steam and fluids, announced the &euro;186m acquisition of Gestra. The German company is primarily a designer of valves and other fluid control systems. The cash consideration represents a multiple of around 12x historic operating profit, and the deal is expected to be earnings enhancing in 2017</p>
        <p>Investors also welcomed StatPro Group&rsquo;s (+41.0%) acquisition of UBS Delta for a cash consideration of &euro;13m. StatPro provides cloud-based portfolio analysis and asset pricing tools to the asset management industry, and UBS Delta&rsquo;s risk and performance analytics should broaden its product offering, allowing it to serve both front and middle office functions.&nbsp; StatPro expects an EBITDA contribution of &pound;2.0m - &pound;3.5m in 2017, which would result in the deal being immediately earnings enhancing. The new functionality will be incorporated into StatPro&rsquo;s core Revolution product, while existing UBS Delta users will be encouraged to upgrade to the full Revolution package. </p>
        <p>As one might expect in this environment, large-cap holdings were a feature among the Fund&rsquo;s performance detractors in April. As equity markets rallied, the steady returns offered by the pharmaceuticals giants were not in favour as investors sought more cyclical exposure. The sector&rsquo;s international sales profile also provided a headwind in light of sterling&rsquo;s 3.2% appreciation relative to the US dollar. Two of the Fund&rsquo;s sector holdings &ndash; AstraZeneca (-5.6%) and GlaxoSmithKline (-6.6%) &ndash; released Q1 results while the third, Shire (-2.7%) is scheduled to do so in early May. Neither AstraZeneca nor GlaxoSmithKline&rsquo;s results showed significant divergence from expected trends, while both contained solid, if unexciting, guidance comments. </p>
        <p>AstraZeneca&rsquo;s sales continued to show the impact of Crestor&rsquo;s patent expiry, falling 10% in constant currency terms. This fed through to a 23% drop in operating profit. Making adjustments for restructuring costs, amortisation and other one-offs, the fall in its &lsquo;core&rsquo; operating profit was a more palatable 2%. With the Crestor expiry expected to weigh on year-on-year comparisons until the second half of the year, the company forecasts a &ldquo;low to mid single-digit percentage decline&rdquo; in 2017 revenue and &ldquo;a low to mid teens percentage decline&rdquo; in core EPS. </p>
        <p>GlaxoSmithKline has also been exposed to patent expiry risk on its key Advair asthma drug from some time, but a generic competitor has yet to be successfully approved in the US. In the absence of a generic, GlaxoSmithKline expects 2017 adjusted EPS growth of 5-7%, but notes that this growth could be wiped out if a generic comes to market. For the first quarter, adjusted EPS rose 9% as constant currency sales increased by 5% to &pound;7.4bn. The sales rise was led by its Vaccines division and &ndash; geographically &ndash; by the US, where sales of its Trumeq and Tivicay drugs were strong and where CDC vaccine stockpile movements were favourable. </p>
        <p>Royal Dutch Shell (-6.0%) was another source of Fund exposure to FTSE100 weakness, suffering from a rolling over in the oil price in the second half of the month, combined with sterling strength. </p>
        <p>Fidessa Group (-5.0%) struck a cautious tone in its Q1 trading statement, maintaining its guidance for constant currency growth in 2017 (a repeat of 2016&rsquo;s rates) but warned that factors such as the Brexit negotiations, European elections and US political uncertainty have caused some customers to delay purchase decisions. Fidessa provides software to the financial industry for applications such as trading and investment management.</p>

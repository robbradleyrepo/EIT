        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Fund (C5 accumulation class) returned -15.1%* in sterling terms in Q1 2020 compared with -14.8% from the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global High Yield Index (GBP hedged). The primary B5 US dollar share class returned -13.9% compared with -14.1% from the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global High Yield Index (USD hedged).</span></strong><span><strong><span> </span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The first few weeks of the year saw high yield bond prices creep higher until the pandemic turned the market on its head. In March, the global high yield market produced a return of -13.3%, leading to a -14.1% return during the quarter. It looked as if returns were going to break the worst month on record (October 2008), though action from central banks and governments, globally, stoked a relief rally.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The US high yield market marginally outperformed its European counterpart. Meanwhile, rating bands performed in the manner you would expect, with higher quality outperforming, yet still down double-digit percentage in the BB cohort. The worst performing sector was energy, which fell over 30% in March.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We are all faced with an extremely uncertain outlook. At times like this, I like to consider the resilience that high yield has shown in previous cycles. Historically, when the market has pushed through 700bps spread, the return profile of a medium-long term investor investing on that day has been excellent. At the end of the month, our favoured sub-set of the market, excluding CCCs and Energy, had a spread of 715bps.<br /></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br /></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center;"><span><img src="-/media/7D6A43DB8114484A9B7E17710C54A8BC.ashx?h=128&amp;w=599" style="width:599px; height:128px;" alt="HY ex energy CCC through 700bps" class="custom-image-height-auto" /></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><em><span>Source: Bloomberg, Liontrust</span></em></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Clearly as the economy deteriorates, defaults are a risk to high yield returns. JP Morgan’s base case is for the European high yield market to have 6% defaults. If this is a good starting point, then the US high yield market, with its high exposure to the US domestic energy sector, could well be higher. We are encouraged that of all the sub-investment grade debt that falls due between 2020 and 2024, only 4% falls due in 2020 and 68% falls due in the final two years (2023 &amp; 2024). This provides a good degree of cushion against refinancing risk. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The next obvious risk to defaults is an inability to service interest payments. This risk is partially captured within credit ratings. Currently 86% of our portfolio is in mid B rated credit and higher. According to Moody’s, writing in mid-February 2020, only 16% of companies rated B2 had weak interest cover and cashflow metrics, and this proportion gradually drops as we move towards the higher rated parts of the market.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Of course, the economic impact is going to be huge in the near term and those company metrics will change rapidly. The Fund does not have significant exposure to thematic and cyclical sectors such as energy, mining, leisure and retail. For example, the Fund has 0.4% in retail (petrol forecourt), c.2% in energy, 1% in mining and 0.5% directly in casinos/hotels/tourism. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The Fund does have around 4% in the auto sector. However, in each case we believe the companies to be resilient. Since the last crisis, the autos sector as a group is significantly less indebted. We believe companies like <strong>Goodyear</strong>, <strong>Schaeffler</strong>, <strong>Gestamp</strong> and <strong>LKQ</strong> are well positioned to weather this storm. Collectively, these four companies had a market cap of US$11bn at the end of the quarter. Market capitalisation can erode quickly, therefore we are not complacent in this regard, but we do take comfort that our autos holdings have sustainable businesses in the long term.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Our dealing has been modest, with no material changes in portfolio shape. We have purchased a former holding that was previously sold on valuation grounds – <strong>Equinix</strong>, a BB+ rated owner of data centres. We have spread our energy exposure across a greater number of holdings by taking small positions in <strong>EQT</strong> and <strong>Occidental</strong>, funded from a reduction of <strong>Enquest</strong>. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>On a personal level, I hope you and all your loved ones are healthy and happy. Wealth is not the most important thing in our lives when we are dealing with the health of our communities, but rest assured we are doing the utmost to continue our professionalism and sustain our investment process during these turbulent times.</span></p>

        <p style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.5pt; text-align: start;"><span style="color: #222222;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Fund’s A5 share class returned 6.5%* in euro terms in December. This compares with the 4.2% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index</span></strong><strong><sup><span>†</span></sup></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>US-China trade negotiations remained the market’s primary focus as the pair edged closer towards a trade agreement. A “phase one” deal, which would see both countries pare back existing tariffs, has been touted for some time but significant strides were made in December. In the days leading up to December 15, the scheduled date for additional US tariffs, Trump said that a deal was “very close” and officials from China also conveyed optimism. The US eventually scrapped the planned tariffs on US$156bn worth of goods and said a truce is expected to be signed in January.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Elsewhere, Christine Lagarde took charge of her first European Central Bank monetary policy meeting, in which the bank maintained policy as expected. Of more interest was Lagarde’s press conference as investors looked for clues over the direction the new president will take for ECB policy. When questioned about whether she is a hawk or a dove, Lagarde remarked that she considers herself as an owl. She also revealed plans for a strategic review of the ECB’s monetary policy. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>It became increasingly likely that the early part of Lagarde’s presidency would overlap with the UK’s exit of the European Union after the Conservative Party won a majority in the UK’s general election. The result gave Boris Johnson a mandate to pass his Brexit deal through parliament and execute the divorce. Initially, the pound rose sharply higher on the perceived clarity of direction, but soon gave up these gains as the market evaluated the economic consequences of Johnson’s Brexit plan. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The sector split on the MSCI Europe showed that aside from communication services (-1.7%), every sector ended higher, with the best performers utilities (+3.8%), financials (+3.6%) and materials (+3.3%). </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The Fund performed strongly in December with only five stocks falling. Many of the best performers participated in the global equity rise without releasing any material newsflow. Among them were a number of UK-listed, domestic focused stocks, such as housebuilder <strong>Vistry Group</strong> (+14.9%) (formerly Bovis Homes Group) and brick maker <strong>Forterra </strong>(+19.4%), which bounced following the general election result.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The Fund’s </span><span>overweight allocation to the energy sector also provided a boost. Stocks such as <strong>Tethys Oil </strong>(+13.8%) and <strong>BW Offshore</strong> (+11.3%)<span style="color: red;"> </span>were among the highlights. Brent oil rose 5.7% over the month as traders became more optimistic about a US-China trade deal and data showed US crude inventories fell to their lowest level in two months.</span></p>

        <p style="color: #222222; margin: 0px 0px 14px;"><span>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The Liontrust European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio of stocks, if the price of one of these stocks should move significantly, this may have a notable effect on the value of the respective portfolio. The Liontrust Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.&nbsp; </span></p>

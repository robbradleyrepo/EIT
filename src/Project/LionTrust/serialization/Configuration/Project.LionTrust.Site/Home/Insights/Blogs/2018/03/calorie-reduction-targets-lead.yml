        <p><span>Health officials in the UK have called on food sellers and manufacturers to cut calories in products by 20% by 2024, with businesses that fail to make the grade to be named and shamed. According to Public </span><span style="color: black;">Health</span><span> England, if this target is met within five years, it could prevent more than 35,000 premature deaths and a</span><span>round &pound;9 billion in healthcare and social care costs could be saved over a 25-year period. </span><span>Government figures show the annual outlay on obesity and diabetes treatment is greater than that spent on the police, fire service and judicial system combined.</span></p>
        <p><span>Delivering healthier foods is a key theme across the <a href="https://www.liontrust.co.uk/what-we-offer/our-funds#Manager=all&amp;Process=SustainableFuture&amp;Page=NaN"><span style="color: #34b233;">Liontrust Sustainable Future funds</span></a> and ongoing pressure to reduce obesity </span>looks set to create structural growth drivers for stocks including Kerry Group, Wessanen, Naturex and Treatt, all of which are helping towards, and profiting from, a shift to healthier and more natural food.</p>

        Key Risks</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital.</strong> The issue of units/shares in Liontrust Funds may be subject to an initial charge, which will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term. Investments should always be considered as long term.</p>
        <p>Some of the Funds managed by the Sustainable Future Equities team involve foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.</p>

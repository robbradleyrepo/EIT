        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust GF Strategic Bond Fund returned 1.6%* in US dollar terms in June, matching the return from the EAA Fund Global Flexible Bond USD Hedged peer group. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Despite the strong rally during the month, our lower-risk approach kept pace by taking risks in the correct areas. In other words, our alpha generation has compensated for the Fund presently running with a low beta. Since inception on 8 May 2018, the Fund is up 6.6%*, well ahead of the 4.8% median despite running with less rate market risk during the period.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Market backdrop</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>After the financial markets&rsquo; tariff tantrum in May came the soothing words of central bankers in June. Practically all asset classes reacted positively to the reassurance that the central banking &ldquo;put&rdquo; is alive and well. After all, who needs capital and infrastructure investment or productivity growth when you&rsquo;ve got cheap money?</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s dovishness has emboldened other central banks who are joining in, and the cynic in me says this is partly due to preventing currency appreciation against the US dollar. The Fed&rsquo;s dot plots have been revised down and the market anticipates a rate cut at its July meeting. This has been referred to by some Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members as an &ldquo;insurance cut&rdquo; and with the market pricing in a 33 basis points (bps) decrease, there are clearly some that think this insurance will take the form of a 50bps cut.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The &ldquo;will the Fed cut&rdquo; question looks like a foregone conclusion, the &ldquo;should the Fed cut&rdquo; question is far more interesting. The short answer, in my opinion, is no. Recent economic data has undoubtedly been weaker than expectations and this can be clearly seen by looking at the economic surprise indices, which are deep into negative territory.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">However, this has been led by the manufacturing sector around the world. Trade and tariff wars have hurt sentiment: there is a large gap between surveys of current conditions and expected future conditions and they have also impacted activity levels and led to big inventory swings. The latter point is one of those classic, easy to predict outcomes: if you tell people tariffs on imports are going up in a few months&rsquo; time, they will stock up ahead of that.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The key is that the service sectors are still strong and employment remains robust. Of course, there will be some contagion from manufacturing to services, but this really is a case of the metaphorical tail wagging the dog. If a resolution can be reached on the trade front, then the markets can start focusing on the strength of consumer spending and the elevated levels of wage inflation. Building in some form of portfolio protection against a dovish policy mistake is central to our present thinking and the Fund&rsquo;s positioning.</span></p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Rates</strong></p>
        <p><span>The Fund continues with the strategy of running with low duration exposure at approximately 2.5 years. We have taken profits on US yield curve steeping positions but still have limited exposure to the 30 year tenor, which will bear the brunt of any rise in long-term inflation expectations. Half of the Fund&rsquo;s duration (1.25 years) emanates from Treasury Inflation protected Securities (TIPS): five-year inflation breakevens at 1.55% and 10- year at 1.70% represent compelling value. </span></p>
        <p><span>Over the last few months, our strong strategic preference for US compared to European duration has been a boon to performance; in June, this positioning had a negligible impact.</span></p>
        <p><span>In the volatile markets, yields lurched up and down and we added performance by opposing larger moves in both directions using 10-year US Treasury futures. The Fund&rsquo;s cross market position, being long Norwegian government debt versus short the German five-year (BOBL) future, generated strong alpha in June. </span></p>
        <p><span>A significant squeeze in Norwegian debt afforded us the opportunity to take profits on the position, and as this technical situation unwound, we started to buy back into Norwegian debt. Just after month end, 1<sup> </sup>July to be precise, we scaled back up to approximately half a year&rsquo;s size.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Allocation</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>Credit spreads were already squeezing inexorably tighter when the despatches from the European Central Bank (ECB) Forum in Sintra started. Further monetary stimulus was effectively promised if economic growth continues to weaken and this included the potential for more quantitative easing. The credit market interpreted this bullishly, as a restart of the ECB&rsquo;s corporate bond buying programme, the CSPP (Corporate Sector Purchase Programme), would have huge ramifications for the demand/supply equation. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">As value diminishes in credit, we have adjusted the Fund&rsquo;s allocation accordingly. The investment grade weighting is about 45% gross through a combination of conventional bonds and floating rate notes; offsetting some of this risk is a low beta 7% US investment grade hedge (CDX IG).</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The constituents within the investment grade holdings continue to be upgraded in quality, with June seeing us sell the Fund&rsquo;s last corporate hybrid bond. In May, we had started adding to high yield using a CDS index overlay and after the strong rally we took profits in June and remain poised to buy any future dip when valuations improve.</span></p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Selection</strong></p>
        <p><span>Longer-dated US corporate bonds aided performance in June. We have been reducing spread duration in the Fund but higher-quality names such as Verizon, Vodafone and Abbott Laboratories were still offering value at longer tenors. On the high yield side, Davita&rsquo;s bonds rallied as they completed the disposal of their healthcare management business.</span></p>
        <p><span>Outside of the sale of the EDF Sterling hybrid, stock level trading activity was limited in June. In the secondary markets, we bought some US dollar Pershing Square debt: this reformed trust has low leverage and bonds are offering over 200bps spread for three-year debt. The one primary deal that left some value on the table was Berkshire Hathaway in Sterling: those bonds are now already over 20bps tighter since launch showing it pays to be selective.</span></p>

        <p><strong><span>Key Risks </span></strong></p>
        <p><span>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The majority of the Liontrust Sustainable Future Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Some of these funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and has a concentrated portfolio of securities, there is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund&rsquo;s share price. Liontrust SF Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Corporate Bond Fund, Liontrust SF Cautious Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Defensive Managed Fund and Liontrust Monthly Income Bond Fund invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions, it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the bonds held by these funds. Mentioned above five funds can also invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interests rates move or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions.</span></p>

        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund’s A5 share class returned -3.3%* in euro terms in June (A4 share class -3.3%). This compares with the -2.5% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index.</strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Central banks had the market’s attention for much of June. The US Federal Reserve continued its tightening cycle with another 25 basis point increase to US rates. ECB President Mario Draghi talked up the strength of the eurozone economy, noting that “deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones”. This raised expectations in the market that a withdrawal of the bank’s substantial stimulus was nearing, which sent the euro higher. Though the ECB claimed the market misjudged Draghi’s speech, the euro still closed the month 1.1% higher in trade weighted terms. The Bank of England also provided hawkish signals, with Chief Economist Andy Haldane seemingly contradicting Governor Mark Carney by suggesting UK rates should rise. </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In the UK, there was a surprise outcome in the general election with Theresa May’s Conservatives losing their majority in parliament, with Labour performing better than expected. The result made a dent in the pound but equities were largely resilient.&nbsp; </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Oil prices were again in focus with Brent touching its lowest level since November 2016 at US$44.82 a barrel as US shale producers continued to upscale production in the wake of Opec output cuts in May. Crude prices began rebounding towards the end of June, but the North Sea benchmark still ended the month 4.8% lower. The MSCI Europe’s energy sector was one of the worst performing sectors (-5.7%), surpassed only by telecoms (-7.2%). The Fund’s holdings in the energy sector included <strong>Fred Olsen Energy</strong> (-23.5%), <strong>SOCO International </strong>(-12.1%) and <strong>Tethys Oil</strong> (-10.6%) which dragged on performance.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">There was, however, a more positive performance for the Fund in the materials sector, with <strong>Ferrexpo</strong> (+20.0%) rising on the back of on higher iron ore prices, while Russian steel maker <strong>Evraz</strong> (+8.2%) received a double upgrade from a broker.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white;"><strong>Sydbank </strong>(+3.4%) did not release any significant newsflow during the month, but participated in the strength in financials (+0.7%), which was the only sector in the MSCI Europe Index to deliver a positive return in June. However, Spanish lender <strong>Liberbank</strong> (-23.6%) missed out on this strength, with its shares falling due to a read across from peer Banco Popular, which had to be rescued by Banco Santander after the ECB declared the bank was “failing or likely to fail”. Investors were concerned that Liberbank may have similar real estate exposure to that which sank Banco Popular.</p>
        <p class="Default">Online gambling company <strong>888 Holdings </strong>(-12.8%) was another detractor after the family which founded the company sold a significant part of their stake at a discount. Later in the month, the shares were also adversely affected by an EU court decision obliging Gibraltar-based gambling companies to pay a levy on a specific betting game. IT company, <strong>Software AG</strong>’s (-10.1%) shares also came under pressure following the announcement that, due to the strengthening of the euro versus the US dollar and other currencies, only a marginal (at best) currency influence was now forecast by the company. This was contrary to some broker expectations for a strong currency tailwind.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white;">There was a small tweak to the Fund’s holdings in June; Valora Holding exited the Fund, replaced by Momentum Group. </p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white;"><br></p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Ferrexpo (+20.0%), Evraz (+8.2%) and Sydbank (+3.4%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Liberbank (-23.6%), 888 Holdings (-12.8%) and SOCO International (-12.1%).</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">*Source: Financial Express, as at 30.06.2017, total return.</p>

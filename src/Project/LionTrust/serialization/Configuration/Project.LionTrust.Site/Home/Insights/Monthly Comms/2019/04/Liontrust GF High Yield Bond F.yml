        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The global high yield market produced its third best Q1 on record with a US dollar return of 6.9% (6.3% in sterling terms and 6.1% in euros), quite a turnaround compared to the negative sentiment which prevailed in December. In a blistering start to 2019, well over half of the return came in January. Since then, the market has gradually risen higher, with modest volatility on the way.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The US market has outperformed its European counterpart, with a return of around 7.4% versus 6.0% (both in US dollar terms). New issuance in either market has been relatively light, which is perhaps surprising given the market backdrop. We looked at one new issue in particular detail – <strong>Power Solutions</strong>. The bond eventually priced with a yield 1% lower than when the deal was announced, illustrating the power is currently in the hands of issuers and their bankers, and we took our order out of the book build.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Early in Q1, the market was reacting to the excellent valuation opportunity created by the late 2018 sell-off. Positive sentiment was then boosted by central bank actions which quelled expectations of interest rate hikes and boosted sentiment around market support and ongoing liquidity.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>In this market environment, one might have thought lower quality bonds would significantly outperform, as is often the case during periods of very strong market sentiment. For example, in the third and first strongest Q1’s on record, CCCs (lowest rated) outperformed BBs (highest rated) by more than 3% and 8% respectively. In Q1 2019, there was a mere 0.6% difference in total return between the highest and lowest quality parts of the market. If you were to risk-adjust returns by credit risk, the higher quality bonds have significantly outperformed. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Personally, I see this as an encouraging sign that the leveraged finance market is more discerning and less in bubble territory than market commentators seem to believe. Of course, if lower quality bonds remain relatively unloved then that has implications for the existing base of bonds and future market-level default rate. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Fund </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br>We added bonds to the portfolio in the last days of December and early part of January, to the point where we had little cash in the Fund. Over the course of Q1, we sold bonds and ended the quarter with cash in excess of 10%. This is a high level of cash for our strategy, and a reflection of the strength of the market in the year to date.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>While all of the Fund’s larger holdings rallied well, within our bucket of smaller, riskier holdings, the Fund suffered a default during the period. Wind Turbine manufacturer <strong>Senvion</strong> is going through a debt restructuring following operational challenges which led to liquidity issues. We reduced the holding by 50% at a distressed price as, in addition to its near term liquidity problems, we see a risk that recent turmoil could impacts its brand and reputation and therefore the sustainability of its franchise. If it can navigate its current problems without too much damage, the bonds should be worth considerably more than they are today (the holding is now 0.3% of the Fund). </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>More positively, transport logistics provider <strong>Direct</strong> <strong>ChassisLink</strong> was acquired by a private equity company which led to a jump in the bond price.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>During the quarter we initiated new holdings including French equipment rental company <strong>Loxam</strong>, gaming machine manufacturer <strong>IGT</strong>, closed ended investment trust <strong>Pershing Square,</strong> and UK regulated electricity distributor <strong>North West Electricity</strong>. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Outlook</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br>Despite the strong market rally, we believe high yield has place in long-term portfolios due to the mitigation against defaults provided by the yield cushion as well as the long-term income generating and value replenishing characteristics of the high yield market. That being said, high yield is an asset class that, in volatility terms, is closer to equities than it is to government bonds. Our general view is that, in the coming years, risk assets will see greater volatility and it makes sense to have ‘dry powder’ to take advantage of opportunities when risk sentiment is weaker. </span></p>

        <strong>Key Risks</strong><strong><br>
        <br>
        </strong>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.<br>

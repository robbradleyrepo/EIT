        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>The Fund’s A5 share class returned 2.0%* in euro terms in July (A4 share class 2.0%). This compares with the 1.3% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index</span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Inevitably, trade war news was ever-present on front pages throughout July. President Trump imposed a tariff on US$34bn worth of Chinese imports, to which China retaliated with levies of its own. Throughout the month Trump signalled that he is willing to impose tariffs on up to US$500bn of Chinese goods. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>However, the developments in the relationship between the US and Europe were more positive. Trump met with President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker late in the month and the pair reached an agreement to cease any further escalation of trade barriers and work on reducing the tariffs already in place. This meant the US would refrain from imposing duties on European car makers, which helped lift share prices in the auto sector.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Away from trade wars, economic growth in the eurozone slowed to a quarterly rate of 0.3% according to the first estimate of Q2 GDP, compared to 0.4% in the first quarter. While the rate was below expectations, it is unlikely that it will derail the European Central Bank’s plans to end quantitative easing.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The performance of the MSCI Europe Index was once again driven by defensive sectors, with health care (+6.3%), telecoms (+3.6%) and consumer staples (+3.5%) all among the best performers in euro terms. The biggest laggards were real estate (+0.4%), energy (+0.8%) and materials (+1.3%). </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Scandic Hotels Group </span></strong><span>(+20.9%) and <strong>Siltronic </strong>(+21.7%) were both among the Fund’s best performers following the release of interim results. Hotel operator Scandic saw second quarter net sales increase by 26% year-on-year to SEK4.75bn, which was ahead of the SEK4.61bn consensus forecast. This was driven by the group’s Restel acquisition in January and other hotel openings. Semiconductor company Siltronic said high demand for wafers boosted sales by 27% year-on-year in the first six months of the year while gross profit doubled. The group slightly lifted its forecasts for the full year on the back of this.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Consumer credit provider <strong>International Personal Finance </strong>(+17.0%) rose after it stated in a trading update that pre-tax profit for 2018 was set to be 10% ahead of consensus estimates following a stronger than expected performance by its European home credit businesses. Later in the month, it released full interim results which showed a 15% increase in pre-tax profit.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span>Interim results were also behind the share price moves of the portfolio’s worst performing stocks. Mining and metallurgical group <strong>ERAMET </strong>(-24.7%) reported a modest rise in sales but margins in its manganese division were squeezed as a result of lower manganese alloy prices. </span><span>Cash handling company </span><strong><span>Loomis </span></strong><span>(-10.0%) also saw a decline in margins as a result of higher costs in relation to restructuring programmes in France and Sweden. Operating income in the second quarter declined 1.5%. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The only change to the Fund’s holdings this month was the exit of Hispania Activos Inmobiliarios after we accepted a revised takeover offer from Blackstone Group.</span><br></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Siltronic (+21.7%), Scandic Hotels Group (+20.9%) and International Personal Finance (+17.0%)</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Macro Thematic team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The Fund’s expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation. The performance of the Liontrust GF Macro Equity Income Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust Macro Equity Income Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</span></p>

        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The Fund returned 2.2%* in sterling terms in July compared with the 0.6% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</strong></p>
        <p>The MSCI World in sterling terms rose 0.9% in July. Strength in US equities was offset by the continuation of the dollar’s recent fall; in July the Dollar Index fell 2.9%. The Fund’s relatively low weighting to the US was therefore a tailwind this month helping it outperform. Its low US exposure reflects the fact that on most measures of value the region is one of the most expensive markets worldwide, restricting the opportunity to find stocks with attractive yields. </p>
        <p>The dollar’s depreciation came as faith in the ‘Trump trade’ further waned following the defeat of the president’s “skinny” healthcare reform in the Senate. Additionally, US economic data has been soft. Low inflation in particular has been a cause for concern and the Federal Reserve noted in its July policy statement that it is “monitoring inflation developments closely”. US stock indices, however, continued to push onto new record highs due to a broadly positive Q2 earnings season.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the euro reached its highest level in trade weighted terms since late 2014. The currency’s appreciation continued to be driven by the market’s expectation that the European Central Bank will soon start tapering its substantial monetary support to the eurozone economy. ECB President Mario Draghi tried to maintain a dovish message in his press conference following the Bank’s decision to leave its policy unchanged, but failed to deter further euro appreciation.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>In the commodity space, oil prices rebounded strongly as US inventories data showed much larger declines than had been forecast. Brent oil rose 9.9% during the month to US$52.7 a barrel. Copper prices also rose to their highest level in two years following reports of a ban on imported scrap metal in China, while iron-ore prices touched a three-month high. This led to strength in the materials sector (+3.1%), which was the biggest sector gainer in the MSCI World Index. <strong>Rio Tinto </strong>(+8.6%) was one of the Fund’s holdings which benefited from the rise in metal prices. Other strong sector performers were telecoms (+2.8%), IT (+2.7%) and energy (+2.1%). The biggest sector fallers were health care (-1.4%), consumer staples (-0.9%) and industrials (-0.5%). </p>
        <p>One of the best performing stocks in the Fund was <strong>Champion REIT</strong> (+20.6%). The Hong Kong real estate investor rose after its Langham Place Office Tower was valued by Savills at HK$24.5bn, almost twice the consensus estimate. Savills hinted that it is in early talks with Chinese buyers for the potential sale of the property. Australian home entertainment retailer <strong>JB Hi-Fi</strong> (+14.1%) rallied alongside other Australian retailers after the country’s retail sales showed growth of 0.6% in May, ahead of consensus expectations for a 0.2% rise. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were a few notable detractors in July, despite the Fund’s strong performance. <strong>Seagate Technology</strong>’s (-16.1%) fourth quarter results to the end of June disappointed with revenue of US$2.41bn, below the market’s US$2.56bn expectation and underlying net income per share coming in at 65 cents versus the consensus estimate of 98 cents. The data storage company also announced 600 job cuts.</p>
        <p>The changes from our spring annual review continued with <strong>Actividades de Construcción y Servicios</strong> exiting the Fund.<strong> </strong>Positions in <strong>BGC Partners </strong>and <strong>Big 5 Sporting Goods</strong> were initiated. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Champion REIT (+20.6%), JB Hi-Fi (+14.1%) and ASR Nederland (+10.4%).<strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Seagate Technology (-16.1%), Bezeq (-12.1%) and Vtech Holdings (-6.6%).&nbsp;</p>

        <p> • Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.&nbsp; The Liontrust European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio which could mean that it will be volatile when compared to its benchmark. The Liontrust Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.</p>

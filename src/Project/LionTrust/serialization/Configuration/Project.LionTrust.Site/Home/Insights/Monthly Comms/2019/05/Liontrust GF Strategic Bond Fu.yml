        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust GF Strategic Bond Fund returned 0.9%* in US dollar terms in April, compared with the 0.8% return from the EAA Fund Global Flexible Bond USD Hedged peer group.&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The Fund posted a strong, positive return during an April, adding to strong first year numbers. Since inception the Fund has returned 4.8%, compared to 1.9% return made by the peer group.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>In my March commentary I reiterated how expensive sovereign debt was, even by excessive recent standards. Since then we have seen a small market retracement. UK Gilts posted a negative return on the month, Bunds were flat and US Treasuries just about made people money. That absolute and relative performance suited fund positioning. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Economic data continued to accelerate and drive a wedge between macro numbers and market expectations for central bank action. A growing source of concern for the bears is that risk asset levels are at least in part predicated on even easier monetary policy. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Two statistics at this point:</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-left: 40px;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>US GDP: Q1 2019, expected 2.3%, actual 3.2%. That’s a nominal rate of growth of over 5%.</span></li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>German CPI: April 2019, expected 1.7%, actual 2.1%. That’s above the European Central Bank’s target level.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Equity and credit markets have of course powered ahead. Cash and short bonds offer increasingly negative real yields, forcing folk to chase risk to earn some income. As long as we convince ourselves the Fed and ECB are there for the market, </span><em style="font-size: 1.5rem;">not</em><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> the economy, we can believe in goldilocks and happy endings.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>President Trump certainly is encouraging even more risk taking, pressuring the Fed to cut. Someone really has to tell him you shouldn’t run an economy as you run a real estate empire. Setting up holding companies, borrowing in their name, dividend stripping and subsequently overleveraging and defaulting is much more difficult to achieve repeatedly at sovereign level – ask Greece, or Venezuela. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Rates<br>
        <br>
        </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>I have to say that rates markets held up much better in April than expected (again!). The combination of decent data and horrible values could have led to material losses for investors. Mid-month, core government markets had fallen by 1%-2%, but recovered as the weight of money chasing yields started to flow back in. That has been the case for a decade now, that technical, QE-led support has prevented yields rising to fair values. Sovereign investors haven’t made much money in nominal terms for nearly four years now and have lost a lot in real terms, but the rise of index trackers, passive funds and asset liability matchers means there is a steady demand for bonds, in addition to that directly controlled and manipulated by central banks. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>So what worked for us in rates markets? We remained “beta light”. We played a bit with duration† moving up from 2 to 3 years as rates markets sold off – as a reminder German bonds were paying -10 basis points at one stage before moving back closer to +10bp, which represents a move of nearly 2% in price. So, the lack of beta helped and our normal alpha plays also added a little value. We want to remain low beta though and have been careful not to allow any short-term changes to the portfolio offset that long-term view. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>US Bonds remained our winners of the sovereign debt “least ugly” contest. Among the G10 they are about the only ones where income offsets inflation. Almost all our sovereign debt exposure was in the US and this worked well. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Allocation</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br>
        We retained our underweight position in most parts of the market. We continued to substitute higher beta for lower beta, so the raw weightings at fund level appeared little changed.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>About 40% of the Fund was invested in sovereign debt, offset by nearly 20% short using bond futures. This created cross market and curve opportunities, most of which worked at the margin. The net duration position from sovereign bonds once futures were deducted was close to zero.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The historic modest correlation between investment grade debt and large cap equities continued. With the S&amp;P 500 hitting a record high during the month, it was no surprise investment grade spreads did okay. Despite prices looking a little stretched, we added a little to the raw weight, moving to around 40% net of derivatives. This is a little lower than our median of 50%, reflecting how expensive the market is. In the medium term we are modestly positive on investment grade credit – the majority of excess returns have been made for the year, but downside risk is limited as global growth continues around trend. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Currently we are down around 12% in high yield against a neutral weight of 20%. Add in the 40% investment grade though and we still have half our portfolio in risk assets, albeit increasingly defensive ones. High yield in particular has had a phenomenal start to the year. Given the nature of this Fund’s strategy, we can afford to reduce the weighting simply because the market looks overbought in the short term. However, we doubt we will go much below 10% unless our macroeconomic view changes – for now we still expect trend growth and inflation for 2019 despite all the central bank doom mongering. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Our preferred emerging market basket (US CDX EM) is close to a three-month low. Most other markets, investment grade, equity and high yield are near their all-time highs. Emerging market fundamentals have deteriorated a bit, which makes me cautious about adding. We may put a small position into the Fund, which currently has a zero weighting. Just don’t expect it in the next few weeks.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br>
        Positive selection was the major reason why the Fund added value in a tricky period whilst maintaining a low risk profile:</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>US rates markets did much better than Asian (ex-Antipodean) or European ones and we had most of our risk in the US. Canada initially outperformed, allowing us to add to our short and then started to slide as data proved too hot for trend investors to handle. Curve trades in US and German markets made us a few pennies, the former modestly steepening, the latter flattening and then steepening, allowing us to make money and rotate. We had added to our inflation protected US bonds and these did very nicely. Last, we made a bit of money moving out of and then back into the UK. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Cash flow in the Fund remained strong but we didn’t add many new names or chase the primary market, we were conscientious in topping up our existing holdings. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Our existing investment grade and high yield bonds generally performed well, in some cases exceeding our price targets and leading to sales or reductions. We continue to work down the subordinated debt we added in December during that long forgotten market panic. Many of those bonds have returned 10% or more in four months. </span></p>

        <strong>Key Risks&nbsp;</strong></span></strong></p>
        <p><span>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.<br>

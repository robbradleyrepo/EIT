        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Summary</strong></p>
        <p>• The Fund’s relative performance was held back in Q2 by an overweight exposure to Thailand and the de-rating of some Chinese mid-caps. Performance trends improved significantly in the last two weeks of June, which can be largely attributed to pick up in stock selection returns on the Fund’s large allocation to Hong Kong and China.</p>
        <p>• A visit to Seoul reinforced our view that South Korea’s new administration will focus on improving corporate governance, continuing to pressure the chaebols to adopt better practices. There has already been a commendable improvement in South Korean dividend payouts and we increased the Fund’s exposure to this market over the quarter. </p>
        <p>• Other changes included an increase in Indian exposure and a small reduction in the Fund’s China and Hong Kong weighting.&nbsp; </p>

        <p>The MSCI Asia Pacific ex Japan index extended its gains in the second quarter, although the &nbsp;Liontrust Asia Income Fund registered a small negative return over the same period.&nbsp; Having lagged the region’s rally so far this year, we are heartened to note that the last two weeks of June saw a significant improvement, which can be largely attributed to our stock selections in Hong Kong and China. </p>
        <p>Prior to that, the Fund’s relative performance was held back by a combination of an overweight position in Thailand – one of the weakest countries in Q2 – and the derating, which in some cases has been fairly sharp, of some long-standing positions, many of which remain among the Fund’s strongest contributors since launch. The Fund’s current bias towards Chinese mid-caps and income stocks left it exposed to investor rotation away from these areas in Q2: as an illustration, the MSCI AC Asia ex-Japan Mid Cap Index lagged the MSCI AC Asia ex-Japan Large Cap Index return by 2.6%. China Communications Services, Jiangnan Group and Texwinca were among the Fund holdings affected.</p>
        <p>Over the quarter there have been some changes to the portfolio. We have discussed at length the changing corporate behaviour in South Korea, and a visit to Seoul last month reinforced our view that the new administration will focus on improving corporate governance, continuing to pressure the chaebols to adopt better practices. Already the increase in dividends is commendable – South Korea’s ten biggest companies have raised the absolute amount they are paying to shareholders by 40% in the past two years. Despite this year’s rally, the country’s equity market valuations remain attractive at 9.3x forward earnings compared to its historic average of 10.5x.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Primarily due to the changes we have increased the Fund’s exposure in South Korea to just shy of 7% from 1.5% as at the end of the first quarter. We bought into KB Financial which, in the last year, has delivered dividend growth of 27% and should benefit from an ongoing focus on cost reduction, loans growth of approximately 4%, as well as a stronger outlook for its non-banking businesses. The shares look attractively valued on a 2017 price/book of 0.7x with a 9% return on equity and 2.3% dividend yield. We also bought into LG Chemical; its preference shares have a higher dividend yield than the ordinary shares of 2.5% with dividend growth of over 10% in the last year. LG Chemical is a fully integrated diversified petrochemical company with relatively lower earnings volatility due to a large exposure to specialty chemicals. Its non-petrochemical businesses include rechargeable batteries for small appliances as well as electric vehicles with strong growth potential.&nbsp; Valuations are well below mid-cycle price/book of 1.9x, and supported by high earnings growth in excess of 30% this year. </p>
        <p>Another change to the portfolio was an increase in the Indian exposure to 8.6% from 6.4% at the end of March, by buying IRB Investment Infrastructure Trust.&nbsp; This reflects our ongoing positive view on the region’s government infrastructure spending, and the company is the first investment infrastructure trust to be listed in India. IRB InvIT has interests in six road projects with estimated 10% revenue growth and a very attractive 12% dividend yield.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Overall, while we acknowledge the positive developments in the Indian market (and India’s Goods and Services Tax implementation on the 1 July is another positive milestone for Modi’s reform programme) we remain mindful of valuations which, at 17.7x forward earnings, stand at a 30% premium to the region.</p>
        <p>Our Hong Kong and China exposure remains significant at 38.2% at the end of June, albeit down from 41.1% at the end of the first quarter. We took the opportunity to sell out of Great Wall Motors which has performed strongly year-to-date following an unexpected 40% rally. The competitive landscape has increased with other local brand manufacturers now focusing on SUVs, which we believe will put pressure on the company’s pricing and profitability. </p>
        <p>We also sold out of First Pacific, again listed in Hong Kong, but with its main assets in telecommunications, consumer food products and infrastructure in the Philippines and Indonesia.&nbsp; In our view, management’s focus on deleveraging the holding company balance sheet and selling underperforming assets increases the risks of dividends declining. We believe there are more attractive alternatives for growth and yield elsewhere.</p>
        <p>We do not believe that China’s economic prospects have diminished, however, and the country shrugged off a credit ratings downgrade in May. Moody’s cited its high debt levels as a concern, but the Ministry of Finance responded that this was “inappropriate” and that the rating agency “overestimated the difficulties facing the Chinese economy”.&nbsp; In turn, the domestic Shanghai Composite index rose by 5% in local currency terms from its 10 May quarterly low up to the end of June.&nbsp; China continues to selectively tighten to manage risks in the system, increasing supervision of insurance companies and investigating overseas loans taken by entities including Dalian Wanda, HNA, Fosun International, Anbang Insurance and the owner of AC Milan. From a growth perspective, China’s 1Q GDP growth of 6.9% year-on-year came in marginally ahead of expectations. Consumption accounted for 77.2% of growth in the quarter compared to 64% in 2016, contributing 5.3 percentage points to the headline figure.&nbsp; A positive reflection of improving global demand came from net exports which posted the first positive contribution since the third quarter of 2015, as well as industrial profits, which for the first five months posted a healthy 22% year-on-year increase.&nbsp; We continue to believe in China’s accelerating reforms and gradual rebalancing to a more domestically focused economy, and that the stocks we hold continue to reflect the underlying driver of increasing domestic consumption.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The final change was in Australia, where our overall weighting declined to 8.4% as at the end of June from 12.5% at the end of the 1Q as one our stocks, Duet, was privatised at A$3.00/share, effectively realising a total return of 105% since our initial investment. </p>
        Looking forward, we think there is much less concern for the economic health of the region, with earnings estimates edging upwards. That said, political risks have escalated. North Korea has fired 17 missiles in 11 tests since February 2017 and, in early July, conducted its first test on an intercontinental ballistic missile which it claims could reach “anywhere in the world”. We continue to echo our views from a few months ago - the risk of a policy misstep is rising and the unpredictability of the situation makes it hard to alter our exposure but it is clearly something that we continue to monitor closely.&nbsp;<br>

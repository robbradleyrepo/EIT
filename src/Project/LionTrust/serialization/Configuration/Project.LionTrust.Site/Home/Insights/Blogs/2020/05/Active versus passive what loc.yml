        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>We believe active versus passive is a needless debate for fund investors &ndash; and they should choose both. For those who insist on this discussion, however, the chart above reveals some recent trends. This shows a family of trackers versus actively managed funds, with passives largely outperforming in the recent downturn (20 February to 23 March) and underperforming in the recovery (24 March to 9 May). In both cases, the US and Asian markets were outliers. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>How does this inform the debate? Unfortunately, extrapolatable data is limited by the fact short-term performance, particularly during crisis periods of indiscriminate selling, is too driven by sentiment. Looking longer-term, however, can provide useful insights: over seven years (how long these trackers have been running), active managers have outperformed, apart from in the US. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Long-term performance also shows which environments favour actively managed funds and, in my experience, they tend to do well when value or small-cap stocks are in the ascendancy. While value has been in the doldrums for over a decade, smaller companies have beaten large caps in all regions apart from the US, where returns from mega-cap tech names have created a fruitful backdrop for passives.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Even when active has beaten passive, the numbers are close enough to 50/50 to please the latter&rsquo;s lobby but we suggest this is exactly why it is vital to identify those few managers with long-term skill. Consistency of performance is impossible over every timeframe, but consistency of investment process is perhaps the most important element in our fund selection.</span></p>

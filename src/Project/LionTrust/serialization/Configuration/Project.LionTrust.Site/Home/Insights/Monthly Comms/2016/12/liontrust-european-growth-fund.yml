        <div><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>The Fund returned +5.2%* in sterling terms in October, compared with the +3.8% return from the MSCI Europe ex-UK index.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>The majority of the European market’s sterling-terms gain reflected further falls in the Pound relative to a range of currencies, including the Euro. In local currency terms, it was a relatively subdued month for the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index. The financials sector was the strongest performing sector, up 12.4% in sterling terms. This was followed by energy, rising 7.2%, and consumer discretionary up 6.5%. The weakest sectors during the month again included real estate (-3.9%), perhaps reflecting the sector’s bond proxy characteristics, followed by information technology (-2.9%) and consumer staples (-1.6%).</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>Action in debt markets was more marked, as global bonds suffered a sharp sell-off driven by an upward shift in the benchmark yield curve. In the US, yields on 10 year Treasury bills rose 13bps. Contributory factors include increasing expectations of a US rate rise at the FOMC’s December meeting, and the ongoing recovery and stabilisation of the oil price. In Europe, despite further speculation that the ECB will extend its asset-purchase programme, the yield on the German 10 year bund rose 28bps. In the UK, better than expected Q3 GDP was also a factor in gilt yields rising 50bps.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>The portfolio kept pace with the market’s rise despite the rally being led by large-cap and value stocks. Relative to the MSCI index the portfolio’s higher energy weight was a positive factor – OMV (+15.1%) and Tetehys Oil (+9.8%) were among the risers – and its large allocation to industrial stocks made a strong contribution. Shares in Deutsche Pfandbriefbank (+16.5%) and Banco Popolare (+29.7%) participated in financials sector strength, the latter helped by shareholder approval of its merger with Popolare Milano. Overall, however, the Fund was underweight to the rallying financials sector.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>Sector rotation was responsible for much of October’s biggest movers, but a selection of holdings also issued notable corporate announcements. CIE Automotive (+11.1%) released a Q3 trading update showing 5% year-on-year growth in revenue in the first nine months of 2016, while operating profit and net profit rose 13% and 26% respectively. Having last month announced a plan to split into two separately listed companies (NKT Cables and Nilfisk), NKT Holdings (+10.7%) took steps towards the new structure, divesting of a non-core cables business and issuing new shares amounting to 9.99% of its share capital in order to pay down debt incurred in the transformational acquisition of ABB’s cables business for an enterprise value of €712m.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>Actelion (-11.5%) announced 14% constant currency sales growth in the first nine months of 2016 and upgraded its full year guidance to “mid teen percentage” growth in operating profit. The guidance upgrade was slightly less than analysts’ consensus expectations and comments from the CEO also caused some concern after he raised the prospect of increased generic competition for Tracleer, one of Actelion’s key drugs. German software infrastructure company Software AG (-9.1%) pre-released a disappointing Q3 earnings result which was below analysts’ expectations due in part to lower revenues from its Licenses business segment.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>
        <div>Swedish food retailer Axfood (-5.9%) has previously stated that 2016 operating profit is expected to exceed&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">2015’s level. Despite issuing a Q3 report showing solid sales progress (+4.2% overall, +0.7% like-for-like) and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">specifying a full year operating profit target of SEK1.9bn – compared with last year’s SEK1.8bn – its share price&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">weakness suggests that investors had been expecting more.</span></div>
        <div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br>
        </span></div>
        <div>In October we sold the holdings in Pandora and Novo Nordisk following a deterioration in their secondary&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">scores in our cash flow screens. We added a new holding in ING Groep.</span></div>
        <div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br>

        <div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></span></div>
        <div>Deutsche Pfandbriefbank (+16.5%), CIE Automotive (+11.1%) and NKT Holding (+10.7%).</div>

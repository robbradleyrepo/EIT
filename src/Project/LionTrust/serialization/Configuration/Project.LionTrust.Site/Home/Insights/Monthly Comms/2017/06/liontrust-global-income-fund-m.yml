        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Fund returned 3.9%* in sterling terms in May compared with the 3.1% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The MSCI World Index rose 2.3% in May. The month’s performance was largely driven by gains in European equities (MSCI Europe ex UK returned +5.2% in sterling terms).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The US lagged the MSCI World following a wobble in market confidence in the <em>Trump Trade</em> as the president came under increasing scrutiny. Trump unexpectedly fired FBI Director James Comey amid an investigation into the president’s ties with Russia. Comey later leaked a memo detailing Trump’s request to halt an investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynn. These developments took some impetus out of the equity market rally, but the S&amp;P 500 still returned 1.3% over May, in US dollar terms. Nervousness was more apparent in currency markets, with the US dollar hitting its lowest level - in trade weighted terms - since Trump’s election in November last year.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Opec struck a deal to extend its production cuts to the end of March 2018 in an attempt to prop up the price of oil. The agreement – first made in November last year - was subsequently endorsed by Russia and other non-Opec members. Oil prices had started the month poorly, with Brent touching its lowest level of the year at US$46.6 a barrel and, despite rallying around 8% from that low, ended the month 2.7% lower.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The MSCI World Index’s energy sector (-1.5%) was the biggest faller in March. Two of the Fund’s energy holdings, Fred Olsen Energy (-14.6%) and Ensign Energy Services (-7.5%) were among its worst performers, tracking falls in oil prices. Additionally, Fred Olsen reported a 37% quarterly fall in operating revenue and a 58% decline in EBITDA in the first quarter. Ensign Energy Services (-7.5%) recorded a 3.0% annual fall in first quarter revenue, partially due to negative currency translation effects as the US dollar weakened against the Canadian dollar. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The MSCI World Index was driven by defensive sectors, with utilities (+6.1%), IT (+5.1%), consumer staples (+4.8%) and telecoms (+4.1%) the top performing sectors. Within the Fund’s holdings in telecoms, Vodacom (+11.7%) was the biggest contributor. During the month, the company bought a US$2.6bn stake in Kenya’s Safaricom from Vodafone Group. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Man Wah Holdings (+21.3%) led the overall list of top stock contributors in May. The Hong Kong-listed furniture company’s share price reached an all-time high after releasing upbeat results for the year to 31 March, with net income coming in ahead of analyst consensus. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">VTech Holdings (+20.8%) also released full-year results which were well received. The electronics manufacturer reported achieved record revenue of US$2.08bn, supported by higher sales in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. The company proposed a full-year dividend of 70 cents, up 67% from the same time last year. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">May saw the conclusion of our annual review of companies’ reports and accounts, which drives the majority of portfolio changes within the Cashflow Solution fund range. However, the yield objective of the Income Fund makes it prudent to consider the dividend payment calendar of our companies when managing the annual restructuring of the portfolio. Therefore portfolio changes are phased according to the timing of dividend receipts.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The result of this phasing is that changes to the Income Fund tend to take place across both Q2 and Q3, slightly later than for the other Cashflow Solution Funds. A selection of changes were implemented in May. Energias de Portugal, ING Groep, Peab, Sampo, Skandinaviska Enskilda and Swedbank were added to the Fund. Banque Cantonale Vaudoise, BP, Centrica, Gjensidige Forsikring, Muenchener Rueckversicherungs Gesellschaft and Standard Life were all removed. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Man Wah Holdings (+21.3%), VTech Holdings (+20.8%) and Vodacom Group (+11.7%).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>

        <p>• Past performance is not a guide to future performance. • Do remember that the value of an investment and the income from it can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.&nbsp;• Some of the Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team invest in smaller companies. These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. • The European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio which could mean that it will be volatile when compared to its benchmark. • The Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.</p>

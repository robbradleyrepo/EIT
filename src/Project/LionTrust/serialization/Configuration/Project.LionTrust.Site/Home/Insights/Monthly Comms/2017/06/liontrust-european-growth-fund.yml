        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Fund returned 2.6%* in sterling terms in May, compared with the 5.2% return from the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index.</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: justify;">It was another busy month on the political scene; Emmanuel Macron achieved a convincing victory in the French election over far-right rival Marine Le Pen. Opinion polls for the general election in the UK tightened, with Theresa May’s substantial lead over Jeremy Corbyn eroding, causing sterling to weaken. </p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: justify;">Market confidence in the <em>Trump Trade </em>wavered as the president came under increasing scrutiny. Trump unexpectedly fired FBI Director James Comey amid an investigation into the president’s ties with Russia. Comey later leaked a memo detailing Trump’s request to halt an investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynn. These developments took some impetus out of the equity market rally, but the S&amp;P 500 still returned 1.3% over May, in US dollar terms. Nervousness was more apparent in currency markets, with the US dollar hitting its lowest level - in trade weighted terms - since Trump’s election in November last year.</p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, Opec struck a deal to extend its production cuts to the end of March 2018 in an attempt to prop up the price of oil. Oil prices had started the month poorly, with Brent touching its lowest level of the year at US$46.6 a barrel. As Opec members indicated an extension to production curbs, Brent rallied around 8% from that low but still ended the month 2.7% lower.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Although ongoing political uncertainty failed to prevent a continuation of equity markets’ steady drift higher, we did observe a reversal of last month’s sector trends with cyclicals underperforming, while defensive sectors drove the gains. Utilities was the best performing sector (+12.5%), followed by telecoms (+9.4%) and consumer staples (+8.5%). The biggest sector laggards were consumer discretionary (+1.1%), materials (+1.4%) and financials (+1.6%). The underperformance of cyclicals, as well as some negative stock specific newsflow weighed on the Fund.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Among these stock detractors was Fred Olsen Energy (-14.6%). The Norwegian offshore drilling company reported a 37% quarterly fall in operating revenue and a 58% decline in EBITDA in the first quarter. Shipping and logistics company DFDS (-6.9%) also disappointed the market with its first quarter results, with both revenue and adjusted EBITDA falling below Bloomberg consensus figures. However, DFDS maintained its outlook for 4% full-year revenue growth.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the biggest contributors to the Fund in May was Technogym (+15.7%). The fitness equipment manufacturer’s first quarter results showed that consolidated revenue grew 7.4% year-on-year, at current exchange rates, driven by strong sales in Asia Pacific and North America. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Energias de Portugal’s (+14.7%) first quarter numbers showed EBITDA came in at €1.01 billion, ahead of the Bloomberg consensus estimate of €977 million. The company added that it expects recurring net profit in 2017 to be higher than 2016.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Nordic hotel operator Scandic Hotels Group (+12.9%) reported a 19.3% year-on-year rise in net sales in the first quarter of 2017, boosted by the timing of Easter. The group also noted that even excluding the impact of Easter, it still achieved double-digit sales growth.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In keeping with the Cashflow Solution investment process, May saw the implementation of changes to the portfolio resulting from our annual review of companies’ reports and accounts. This review includes a forensic analysis of companies’ historic cash flows and balance sheet developments. We apply a simple quantitative screen using two measures of cash flow to create a composite ranking of the universe of companies, with only the top 20% qualifying for further qualitative analysis. We then apply additional ‘secondary’ scores which further distil down the universe to what we believe are the best types of investment opportunity the top quintile of cash flow will offer.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">New positions were initiated in Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles, Dassault Aviation, Energias de Portugal, Investor AB, JM AB, Lenzing, Liberbank, Loomis, Orion, Scandic Hotels, SimCorp, SEB Group, Stora Enso, Subsea 7 and Technogym.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Following the review, the Fund continues to have a bias towards growth stocks, though there are still selective value opportunities available. We characterise these value opportunities as ‘recovering value’ (companies that are reining in capex and tightly managing working capital in order to aid financial recovery) rather than ‘contrarian value’ (companies suffering a prolonged period of poor trading; may be restructuring or selling off assets). We remain very wary of stocks scoring well on ‘contrarian value’ measures as these companies tend to perform poorly in environments when investor anxiety is very low, as it is currently.</p>

Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.&nbsp;• Some of the Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team invest in smaller companies. These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. • The European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio which could mean that it will be volatile when compared to its benchmark. • The Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.</p>

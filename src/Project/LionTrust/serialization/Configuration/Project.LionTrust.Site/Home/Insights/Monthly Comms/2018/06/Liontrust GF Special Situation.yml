        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>The Liontrust GF Special Situations Fund returned 3.9%* in May, compared with the 2.8% return from the FTSE All-Share Index</span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The Bank of England chose not to raise rates in May, a decision the market had moved to price in over the last few weeks. UK rate tightening later this year may still be possible with Mark Carney appearing to attribute weak Q1 economic data to the unusually cold weather – a factor that the ONS thinks was less significant. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Trade war worries were largely on the back burner for May, but on the last day of the month Trump announced that tariff exemptions previously granted to the EU, Canada and Mexico would now be removed, raising the prospect of retaliatory measures. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Oil climbed a further 3.2% to US$77.6 a barrel (Brent crude) at the end of May, having hit US$80 during the month. Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal with Iran, re-imposing sanctions on the country, which is a large oil producer. Economic turmoil in Venezuela also led the International Energy Agency to warn of a potential “double supply shortfall”. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>In Europe, a deterioration of Italy’s political crisis saw financial stocks weaken as investors fretted over the risks to the Eurozone. Attempts to form a coalition government of populist parties were thrown off course as Italy’s president blocked the alliance’s Eurosceptic nomination for finance minister. This prompted a sharp sell off in Italian bonds and hit shares in European banks. However, as the month drew to a close, it seemed that another deal to form a government was looking likely. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Most sectors of the UK market finished May in positive territory, but there were a couple of notable exceptions in the form of telecoms and financials, which together represented a 50bps drag on FTSE All-Share performance. This was a headwind the Fund largely side-stepped due to its avoidance of banks and large-cap telecoms (the Fund’s only sector holding is <strong>Gamma Communications</strong> which edged 1.6% higher during the month). </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The Fund’s largest riser in the month was<strong> Wood Group</strong> (+17.9%). It was awarded a “$US multi-million contract” by TEVA Biotech for a range of engineering and construction services on a new biotech facility in Germany. The deal, while significant in its own right, also furthers Wood Group’s ambitions to diversify away from its historic dependence on the upstream oil &amp; gas sector. The company, which acquired Amec Foster Wheeler in 2017, aims to offer engineering services to a wide range of energy and industrial markets. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Paypoint</span></strong><span> (+15.7%) represented another bright spot in the portfolio. The company provides electronic point of sale (EPoS) systems to convenience stores as well as using these stores to offer services including bill payments, ATMs and <em>Collect+</em> parcel pick up &amp; drop off. Its network covers over 40% of the UK convenience store market. Paypoint’s statutory 2017 results – net revenue down 3.5%, profit before tax falling 23.4% – were<strong> </strong>skewed by the refocus of its business last year through the sale of its PayByPhone and Drop and Collect businesses. When adjusted for its continuing operations, financial performance was slightly ahead of consensus expectations.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>dotDigital</span></strong><span> (-18.6%) featured on the downside, albeit due to investor speculation rather than concrete newsflow. The EU’s GDPR standards were implemented in May. While these should support demand for dotDigital’s omnichannel marketing software tools in the long term, the company has previously commented that clients are initially reacting by lengthening purchasing cycles. In addition, e-commerce platform Magento – one of dotDigitals’ most important channel partners – was acquired by Adobe in May, creating some uncertainty over which direction Adobe will take the relationship. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Metrology group<strong> Renishaw </strong>(+13.9%) grew revenues by 12% in the nine months to 31 March 2018, a top-line uplift which dropped through to an almost 40% expansion in adjusted profit before tax. The strength of trading led it to upgrade its full-year financial forecasts. Revenue guidance has been increased from £575m - £605m to £585m - £605m while the profit before tax range has been raised from £127m - £147m to £135m - £150m.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Intertek </span></strong><span>(+12.6%), the quality assurance provider, issued a trading update covering the first four months of 2018. On a constant currency basis revenue rose 4.4%, the majority of which was organic growth. The company stated that it is on track to deliver good constant currency organic review growth, moderate margin expansion and strong cash conversion in the year to 30 June 2018. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>TP ICAP</span></strong><span> (-11.1%) slid after stating that weaker trading in power and credit had offset a pick-up in equity volatility and better conditions in rates products Revenue in the first four months of 2018 was 3% higher year-on-year.<span style="color: red;"> </span>Shares<strong> </strong>in<strong> CareTech Holdings </strong>(-8.1%) also lost ground despite an interim trading update stating that results for the six months to 31 March would be in line with market expectations. The specialist social care services provider increased net residential and supported living capacity by 28 to 2,572 places. Occupancy levels in its mature estate were unchanged at 93%. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Market research and data analytics group <strong>YouGov</strong> (+18.8%) has expanded its presence in the sports data market through the acquisition of SMG Insight Limited. YouGov bought 20% of SMG in 2010 and is now purchasing the remaining 80% from the firm’s founder Frank Saez. A cash consideration of £1m is payable at completion, a further £1m is due after 12 months and deferred consideration of 4.25x EBITDA over the next three years will be paid under an earn-out which keeps Saez at the head of the SMG business. The total consideration is capped at £21m, which would be about 17.5x this year’s profit before tax.<br> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><br></p>

Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital.</b></span><span>The issue of units/shares in Liontrust Funds may be subject to an initial charge, which will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term. Investments should always be considered as long term.</span></p>

These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies.</span></p>

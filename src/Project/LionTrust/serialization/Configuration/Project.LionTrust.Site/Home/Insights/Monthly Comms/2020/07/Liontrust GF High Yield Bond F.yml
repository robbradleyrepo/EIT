        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>The Fund (C5 sterling accumulation class) returned 11.5%* in sterling terms in Q2 2020 while the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global High Yield Index (GBP hedged) </span></strong></span><span><strong><span>comparator benchmark returned 11.0% and the average return for the IA Sterling High Yield reference sector was 11.2%. </span></strong></span><span><strong><span>The primary B5 US dollar share class returned 11.8% while the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global High Yield Index (USD hedged) comparator benchmark returned 11.1% and</span></strong></span><span><strong><span> t</span></strong></span><span><strong><span>he average return for the EAA Fund USD High Yield Bond (Morningstar) reference sector was 8.7%.</span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br /></p>
        <p><span>The high yield market, fuelled by the actions of central banks, produced its best quarterly return since Q3 2009. This was quite the turnaround after the alarm and panic of March, which you will remember brought the worst quarterly return since Q4 2008.</span></p>
        <p><span>The European high yield market significantly outperformed its US counterpart during the quarter. For example, ICE BofA US High Yield (GBP hedged) produced a return of 9.5%, whilst ICE BofA European High Yield (GBP hedged) produced a return of 11%. </span></p>
        <p><span>The strong performance of European high yield has played out most clearly in single B &amp; CCC rated bonds. For the global market, lower-quality bonds produced big returns – particularly in the second half of the period. For example, bonds rated CCC and lower produced a return of 12% (US dollar terms) in May and June combined, versus 6.7% (US dollar terms) for the global high yield market as a whole.</span></p>
        <p><span>The Liontrust Global High Yield Fund produced a quarterly return slightly ahead of that of the ICE BofA Global High Yield Index. Its performance versus peers since inception remains very good, solidly in the first quartile. In the more recent comprehensive rally, the Fund has lost some ground to peers, suggesting many have a greater exposure to lower-quality credit. </span></p>
        <p><span>We also compare the Fund’s performance to a leading Global High Yield ETF (seeking to outperform by 1.5% a year)<sup>†</sup>. The Fund’s C5 sterling shares class produced similar returns to the ETF in the quarter and is now around 3.2% ahead since inception (June 2018)</span></p>
        <p><span>We exited very few of the holdings that we owned at the start of the quarter. Given the environment we are in, this is a good illustration of the robustness of our process, where we focus on quality and the avoidance of accumulations of thematic risk. </span></p>
        <p><span>In the areas we tend to have low exposure to, such as energy and lower quality, we have purchased and subsequently sold two oil exploration and production companies at decent profit, <strong>EQT</strong> and <strong>Occidental</strong>. We also purchased and sold CCC-rated <strong>Diebold</strong>, a manufacturer of ATMs. These were each relatively small positions. We also purchased and subsequently sold bonds from data centre company, <strong>Equinix</strong>. This was a bigger position size, around 1.5%, which was sold after the company was upgraded to investment grade and the valuation moved to reflect this.</span></p>
        <p><span>We also have added a number of new ideas which we expect to be more typical, longer-term holdings. For example, <strong>AMS</strong> is a sensors business which has borrowed money to acquire the majority of a peer. AMS is arguably over-exposed to Apple in its consumer business, whereas the acquired business is particularly exposed to the cyclical autos sector. We believe the clear diversification benefits provide industrial logic to this merger. To part-fund the purchase of AMS, we sold the small residual holding in a similar company, <strong>Sensata</strong>.</span></p>
        <p><span>We continue to have low exposure to thematic, cyclical sectors (such as energy, retail and mining) or CCC-rated bonds (&lt;5%). </span></p>
        <p><span>Looking back at the Global Financial Crisis, by Q3 2009 the ‘bazookas’ thrown at financial markets had helped foster some semblance of economic stability, which played out positively in the sales and cash flows of borrowing companies – an excellent backdrop for a strong rebound out of crisis.</span></p>
        <p><span>Today, we are seeing some positive signs that looser lockdown and the extraordinary central bank actions are clawing back economic activity. Nowhere has that been more evident than in high yield bond issuance. For example, the first half of 2020 has seen US high yield supply of US$203bn, which is already only 23% lower than the whole of 2019 and 19% higher than the 2018 full-year total. </span></p>
        <p><span>Yet the clear difficulty in containing virus cases in large parts of the US, combined with the spectre of fresh outbreaks globally, means summer 2020 feels a lot more uncertain than the later months of 2009. We also don’t know what the long-term effects of this crisis on various sectors could be. </span></p>
        <p><span>In that context, it is perhaps surprising just how strong high yield returns have been in Q2, particularly the very strong outperformance of the weakest bonds/sectors towards the end of the period. Despite this recent dynamic, we are not being seduced by higher yields from weaker companies in order to sustain those high returns. If that means a period of under-performance relative to peers and index awaits us if the more vulnerable credit risk continues to outperform, then so be it! </span></p>
        <p><span>With all this uncertainty, our concrete convictions rest in the companies we lend to and the idiosyncratic nature of the Fund we have constructed for its unitholders. We believe this provides a resilience to defaults in addition to a decent source of income and returns, even if we experience volatility in the coming weeks and months. With a yield of 5.8% (C5 GBP class), we believe the high-quality High Yield Fund continues to provide good long-term prospects for its investors in a world of very low yields and equity dividend uncertainty. </span></p>

        <p style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.5pt; text-align: start;"><span style="color: #222222;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

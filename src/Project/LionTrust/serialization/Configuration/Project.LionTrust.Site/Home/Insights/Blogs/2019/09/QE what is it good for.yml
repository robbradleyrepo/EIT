        <p><strong><span style="color: black;">While not quite absolutely nothing, it is clear that, over recent years, the impact of quantitative easing (QE) has dwindled to the point where new programmes arguably provide little net benefit to the real economy.</span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Although the situation is similar for all the countries that have had large-scale QE, the European Central Bank (ECB) experience is a particularly good example to examine due to its size and breadth and the results it has delivered. This is also an opportune moment to review QE in Europe given that the ECB has just announced a new round of open-ended asset purchases, to the tune of </span><span style="background: white; color: black;">€20 billion a month from 1 November. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">To understand why QE is now a far less effective tool, it is important to remember why it was initially introduced in March 2015 and reflect on the changes in economies and markets since.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Originally, the ECB was reluctant to implement QE as it feared the sharp and sizeable increase in liquidity would lead to significant inflationary risks. Added to this, the approach was largely untested so it was impossible to predict the outcome and any unintended consequences. However, following a period in which conventional monetary easing was largely exhausted, it was clear a new strategy was needed to address several concerns in early 2015, including:</span></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span style="color: black;">Bank balance sheets were too large and they needed to de-lever to comply with tighter banking regulations. </span></li>
            <li><span style="color: black;">Capital markets were not operating efficiently: financial and non-financial companies were struggling to finance at affordable levels.</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: black;">European economic growth remained very weak and inflation stubbornly low despite monetary easing.</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: black;">There was a risk that member countries would seek to leave the eurozone.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="color: black;">By injecting liquidity into the system, the ECB successfully provided banks with the time and space they needed to increase their capital, work through their non-performing loan stock and access affordable funding. Without this, bank deleveraging would have been quick and dramatic and would have resulted in significant levels of corporate and personal failures and a far bigger negative impact on the real economy. A number of second-tier banks would also likely have failed.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">QE also provided confidence to capital markets, allowing companies to fund at affordable levels through the bond market rather than rely on banks. Finally, it significantly reduced government yields to help reduce the funding burden on governments throughout Europe to alleviate the impact of high levels of government debt. The final point has been so “successful” that German 30-year bonds, until last week, traded on negative yields.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img height="375" alt="German 30-year Government bond yield" width="600" src="-/media/6291E456A4BD45229A9F19F7CEAB6845.ashx?h=375&amp;w=600" class="custom-image-height-auto"></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Simplistically, the ECB’s QE programme successfully unblocked the supply side of monetary policy while its aggressive policy easing helped address the problem of a lack of demand for money. But while it is obvious emergency yields and QE were both necessary and successful after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), it is less clear what further easing and QE will achieve as today’s challenges are different.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="color: black;">First off, companies now have ongoing access to plentiful funding at historically low levels of yield. Government yields are negative across much of Europe, and even peripheral government yields are very low (2.0% for Italy, and 1.0% for Portugal and Spain). Corporate bond spreads are also close to post-GFC lows.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> <img height="375" alt="European fiveyear Investment Grade spreads basis points" width="600" src="-/media/66B4719895F149C4B16A76250F388942.ashx?h=375&amp;w=600" class="custom-image-height-auto">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">With yields and spreads at historically low levels, it is hard to believe the marginal reduction in rates will encourage companies to increase borrowing to invest, as evidenced by the fact that many are not willing to do so when they can to borrow five-year funds at zero cost. Today’s problems are neither supply related nor due to unaffordable pricing, but rather confidence related. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">While the downturn in global growth over the last 12 months, largely caused by various international trade disputes, has damaged confidence, QE may also be to blame in part. Negative yields undermine confidence by sending a message of no growth or impending recession, reducing consumption because savers and pensioners who rely on low-risk investments (cash or bonds) are not receiving an income. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Governments now effectively own a significant proportion of bond markets (at low or negative yields) and this could also undermine economic growth over the long term. This is because low yields negatively impact the solvency of pension and insurance funds. Historically, low yields, coupled with a flattening of the curve, also undermine bank profitability. At least by (finally) introducing deposit tiering in its recent QE announcement, the ECB has helped to mitigate the impact of negative yields on earnings for European banks.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">While QE has done much of the heavy lifting to prop up growth within Europe, we need to be aware of its limitations and unintended consequences. It may make theoretical sense to allow countries and companies to borrow at zero or below, but it makes no sense for investors to buy these bonds. To do so, investors are being asked not only to lock into a ludicrously low return but more dramatically a likely negative real return of between -2% and -3%. Moreover, it is also worth bearing in that mind that bonds will potentially suffer large capital losses when central banks eventually succeed in their efforts to boost the economy and inflation. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">By way of an example, investors that own the newly issued German 30-year government bond will suffer a mark-to-market loss of over 25% in the event that its yield increases to a mere 1.00% from its current -0.02%. Perhaps investors are starting to wake up to these realities: when this new issue came to market last month, there was only EUR800m of real demand, compared to the government’s target issue size of more than EUR2bn.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">The ECB has done all (and more) that could reasonably be expected to support the economy and, as such, it is now the turn of governments to help through fiscal measures. Governments “owe” the ECB this much, particularly as all EU countries have benefited from the abnormally low yields they have been able to borrow at over recent years.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

        <strong><span>Key Risks </span></strong></span></strong><span><br>
        <br>
        <strong><span>Past performance is not a guide to future performance.</span></strong> Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The majority of the Liontrust Sustainable Future Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Some of these funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well-regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and has a concentrated portfolio of securities, there is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund’s share price. Liontrust SF Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Corporate Bond Fund, Liontrust SF Cautious Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Defensive Managed Fund and Liontrust Monthly Income Bond Fund invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions, it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the bonds held by these funds. Mentioned above five funds can also invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interests rates move or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions.<br>

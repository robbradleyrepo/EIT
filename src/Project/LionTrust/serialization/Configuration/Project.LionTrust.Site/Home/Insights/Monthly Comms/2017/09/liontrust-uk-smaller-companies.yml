        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned 0.6%* in August, compared with the -0.7% return from the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index.</strong></p>
        <p>While the depreciation of the pound was a key factor in driving the large-cap FTSE100 Index to a monthly gain, the returns from the mid and small cap segments of the UK market were more subdued. In the absence of a clear market trend, small caps again displayed their idiosyncratic nature, reacting to a combination of stock-specific developments and investors’ reassessment of companies’ prospects.</p>
        <p>Four stocks in the portfolio saw share price movements in the month which exceeded 20%. Of these, <strong>System1</strong> Group (-29.3%) was the biggest mover. Having enjoyed a strong bull run over the course of the previous year, thanks to buoyant trading and a series of forecast upgrades, the marketing company saw its fortunes head into reverse. A trading update warned that the new financial year to March had started more slowly than last year, affected by the non-recurrence of large one-off orders last year, some clients deferring marketing spend and a more competitive end market. Coupled with a larger cost base, thanks to investment in senior hires in the US, System1 now expects full year profit before tax to come in around 10-15% lower than the prior year. While the news serves as a cautionary tale with regard to companies exposed to lumpy project revenue and potentially more discretionary areas of clients’ marketing spend, we believe the business’ intellectual property – its core Economic Advantage strength – remains intact, and therefore continue to hold the shares.</p>
        <p><strong>Keywords Studios</strong> (+26.1%) followed up last month’s strong showing – on the back of an interim trading update – with more share price gains as it announced a batch of new acquisitions. The provider of outsourced art, localisation and testing services to the video games industry has acquired three separate businesses, all based in Paris. The acquisitions strengthen Keywords Studios’ audio recording and localisation services in French which the company states is, alongside German, the most important localised language for games. The total consideration of €7.6m (of which €1.0m is deferred and contingent) equates to around 8 times historic profit before tax.</p>
        <p>In late July, <strong>Bioquell</strong> (+26.1%) announced interim results showing 19% growth in revenues to £14.3m. Stripping out declining sales from its Defence business, growth from its Bio-decontamination products and services was 27%. This top-line growth was supplemented by an improvement in margins, leading to profit before tax more than trebling to £1.4m. It also stated that business momentum has led it to believe that full year profit before tax will exceed current market expectations. The company is at an inflexion point in its transition away from legacy Defence business towards Bio-decontamination. This process took another step forward in August with the disposal of its Airflow service business. It had ceased production of Airflow safety cabinets in 2013 but has supported the legacy products with service engineers and spare parts.</p>
        <p>Completing the four largest movers is customer engagement software provider <strong>Netcall</strong> (-20.2%), which announced the acquisition of low-code software development platform MatsSoft during August. Despite the earnings accretive nature of the deal, Netcall’s shares were de-rated by the market as a trading update released in conjunction with the acquisition highlighted a profit warning in the underlying business. The company is currently undergoing a transition from a traditional licence-based revenue model to a subscription-based revenue stream. While the increased visibility of earnings post the transition will be a welcome longer-term development for the stock when viewed through the lens of the Economic Advantage investment process, short term profitability has been impacted by delayed revenue recognition on subscription sales.</p>
        <p>Further down the gainers board is <strong>Smart Metering Systems</strong> (+14.6%) which rose as investors welcomed the news that the company had signed a new meter rental agreement with Utility Warehouse. The contract will see it provide a minimum of 100,000 new domestic smart meters and is another example of how it is benefiting from the UK requirement that domestic energy supply companies have smart meters fitted for all residential and small business customers by 2020.</p>
        <p>Shares in <strong>Empresaria Group </strong>(-9.6%) slid on publication of its interim results, but only to the extent that they retraced gains made on the back of its July trading update. The recruitment company grew net fee income by 26% to £34.4m in the six months to 30 June, while adjusted profit before tax improved by 12%. The company expects to meet consensus financial expectations for the full-year statement and suggested that further bolt-on acquisitions should be expected.</p>
        <p>The only portfolio change during August was the sale of <strong>GB Group</strong>. With the retirement of CEO Richard Law, who owns nearly 1% of the company’s shares, the Board’s equity ownership slipped below our 3% threshold and triggered the company’s sale from the portfolio.</p>

        <p>• Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</p>

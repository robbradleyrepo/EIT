        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund’s A5 share class returned 3.13%* in euro terms in March (A4 share class 3.09%). This compares with the 2.7% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index.</strong></p>
        <p>The rally seen in stock markets in recent months continued strongly in March with the MSCI Europe Index rising 3.3% (euro terms). While the UK formally triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon and subsequently started the negotiation process for the UK‘s exit from the European Union, this had been well flagged and largely discounted by markets. Instead, investors in Europe focused on increasingly positive macro data. This included strong PMI data, a narrowing of the output gap, and the interpretation by some market participants of a less dovish tone in comments from ECB President Mario Draghi.</p>
        <p>In the US, investors increasingly looked for evidence that the president can deliver on the election rhetoric for improved growth and infrastructure spend. The healthcare reform debacle (the failure by Trump to repeal Barack Obama’s healthcare law) did little to ease investors’ rising concerns. On the central bank front, the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates by 25 basis points as expected but the Federal Open Market Committee maintained its median estimate of three rate increases in total for 2017, slightly more dovish than some in the market anticipated.</p>
        <p>The rise in the MSCI Europe Index was led by utilities (+5.5%), financials (+5.2%), IT (+4.9%) and consumer discretionary (+4.3%). The weakest performing sectors included real estate (+1.1%) and energy (+1.5%).</p>
        <p>Bobst Group achieved the highest return (+20.4%) of all portfolio stocks after reporting strong 2016 results. The company, which supplies machinery and services to the packaging industry, announced that sales had risen 8.7% from 2015, helping operating profit rise 23.6%. Bobst proposed a dividend of CHF1.70 per share, up from CFH1.25 in the prior year, and maintained that it expects 2017 operating profit to be similar to 2016.</p>
        <p>Online gambling company 888 Holdings (+15.3%) pleased the market by delivering an 82.2% annual rise in pre-tax profit in 2016, with revenue up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by a strong performance in its Sports and Casino divisions. The total dividend for the year was lifted to 19.4 cents per share from 15.5 cents in 2015. 888 indicated that trading in 2017 remained healthy, with average daily revenue more than 11% above the comparable period at constant currencies. </p>
        <p>Domino’s Pizza Group’s (-18.3%) 2016 results showed growth, albeit with some signs of deceleration. Profit before tax rose to £82.5 million from £73.2 million in 2015, and system sales up 14.5% year-on-year. Investors were disappointed by the pizza delivery company’s start to 2017, where UK like-for-like sales in the first nine weeks were up only 1.5%.The Fund’s holding in Domino’s was sold following a deterioration in its cash flow characteristics. </p>
        <p>Brent oil also fell by 5% to $52.8/barrel. This affected the portfolio’s holdings in Tullow Oil (-12.7%) and Tethys Oil (-10.4%). The move in Tullow’s share price also reflected a £600m rights issue in order to pay down debt levels. </p>
        <p>Positive contributors to performance included:</p>
        <p>Bobst Group (+20.4%), Banco BPM (+17.9%) and 888 Holdings (+15.3%).</p>
        <p>Negative contributors to performance included:</p>
        <p>Domino’s Pizza Group (-18.3%), Tullow Oil (-12.7%) and Tethys Oil (-10.4%).</p>

        <p>• Past performance is not a guide to future performance. • Do remember that the value of an investment and the income from it can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.&nbsp;• Some of the Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team invest in smaller companies. These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. • The European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio which could mean that it will be volatile when compared to its benchmark. • The Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.</p>

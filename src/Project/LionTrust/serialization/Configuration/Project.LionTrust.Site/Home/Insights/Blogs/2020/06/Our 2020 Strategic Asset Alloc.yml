        <p><strong><span style="color: black;">The key points from our 2020 strategic asset allocation (SAA) review are:</span></strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><strong><span>The SAA is designed to achieve long-term goals rather than reflect short-term market shifts.</span></strong></li>
            <li><strong><span style="color: black;">Our latest SAA review was done pre-Covid 19 and therefore continues to reflect the largely lower volatility environment of recent years.</span></strong></li>
            <li><strong><span>Overall allocations to equities, bonds and alternatives have remained broadly static but there have been changes within this, with reductions in expensive and underperforming UK equities and increased weightings to Europe and Japan.</span></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p><strong><span style="color: black;">A key part of our target risk Multi-Asset investment process is understanding the fact that successful fund management combines elements of art and science. </span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">We have a clear scientific element in the form of our SAA, which is designed to enable each portfolio to achieve the level of risk intended. </span><span>Broad correlations between asset classes tend not to change – equities are higher risk than bonds, for example – so if our underlying assumptions are correct, our SAA is unlikely to move too much year on year. </span></p>
        <p><span>What we do get is more information on correlations and volatility data and we continue to evolve the SAA in line with these. Working with Liontrust’s risk team, we collate and analyse the historical returns and volatilities of a range of asset classes, as well as their correlations with each other, to determine the best SAA for each model portfolio to meet its volatility target over the long term. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Writing about our 2020 SAA update is interesting in that we largely did the work before the full implications of Covid-19 became clear </span><span>– <span style="color: black;">and the numbers therefore continue to reflect the lower volatility of recent years. Volatility has been lower than long-term averages, depressed by the quantitative easing that began in the wake of the global financial crisis and has continued, in one form or another, ever since. </span></span><span style="color: black;">Expected long-term volatility (based on 10 years) for our Risk Grade 8 portfolio is between 17% and 19%, for example, but as the chart shows, we would only have hit that level in one three-year period going back to 2002, the height of the financial crisis from 2008 to 2010.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: black;"><img src="-/media/AB8B214A769849999A38301CE4638A1C.ashx?h=216&amp;w=600" style="width:600px; height:216px;" alt="Liontrust Multi-Asset Annualised Volatility" class="custom-image-height-auto" /></span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;"><i>Source: Liontrust, 2020</i></span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">More recently, we have seen volatility gradually moving back towards longer-term averages and there has been a recent rise in the wake of Covid-19. While this may mean further changes to our SAA when we review the position next year, we would still not expect anything too substantial as we continue to use long-term data.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">While volatility has been lower over the last decade, we are not tempted to chase either risk or the market itself, both of which can lead to a risk spike in the short term and potentially higher drawdowns. As our investors will know, our process is built on the foundations of winning by not losing over the long term by focusing on downside limitation before upside generation </span><span>– </span><span style="color: black;">and chasing risk obviously runs counter to this strategy.</span></p>
        <p><span>Whenever we discuss SAA, it is important to reiterate any moves are not tactical shifts but rather how the data dictate we can best achieve our volatility targets: the changes reflect underlying shifts in the risk and return profiles of all these asset classes. Recent market upheavals due to Covid-19 provide a good opportunity for us to highlight exactly what SAA is and, just as importantly, what it is not, particularly relative to peers who move their strategic allocation around more aggressively.</span></p>
        <p><span>The SAA <span style="color: black;">is our allocation should we have no views on the relative attractiveness of asset classes, the middle lane of the motorway if you will, and now is not the time to be changing that substantially: we have chosen our route to get to our ultimate investment destination. Where we can add value and take advantage of cheaper valuations is via our tactical asset allocation, and how we select funds to implement our views. This is where we can move into the fast lane in certain areas, to continue our analogy.</span></span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">For the latest SAA review, w</span><span>e produce low, medium and high-risk SAA allocations, equating to portfolios 3, 6 and 8 in our 1-10 range of risk profiles.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><span></span><img src="-/media/DD582CD1AF144966ADC0EA7559C54CB0.ashx?h=449&amp;w=601" alt="Liontrust Multi-Asset Strategic Asset Allocation" class="custom-image-height-auto" style="font-size: 1.5rem; height: 449px; text-align: center; width: 601px;" /></p>
        <p><i><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Source: Liontrust, June 2020</span></i></p>
        <p><span>Changes have been fairly small, and the overall allocations to equities, bonds, cash and alternatives are broadly the same as in 2019. </span></p>
        <p><span>Within equities, there have been a few changes, with the UK (and UK smaller companies) falling again, reflecting the region’s re-rating on a global level in light of Brexit and ongoing sterling weakness. In contrast, Europe and Japan exposure has increased slightly. Within bonds, developed market government exposure has fallen on the low-risk model, with a higher weighting to high yield and slightly more in emerging market debt in the medium-risk model. Finally, for the alternatives allocation, only represented in the medium-risk SAA, the property and hedge funds weightings have both fallen and commodities, included for the first time last year, has increased.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span>To reiterate, there is no tactical element to these changes but given the process is designed to produce the optimum basket of assets in terms of risk/reward to meet our volatility targets, the moves will often chime with our tactical thinking.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span>We are keen to move the TAA to a more aggressive footing post-Covid 19, while remaining within our risk parameters. </span><span style="color: black;">We have been neutral since October 2018 when we pared back our US equity exposure, favouring areas where we see the best value – namely Europe, Japan, Asia and emerging markets. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">At any point in time, our TAA ranges from one to five, with one being the most bearish on markets and five the most positive. We believe recent events give us scope to take advantage of cheaper equity valuations and increase risk to five. We would expect to continue favouring those same areas, which have been left behind by the surging US growth names in recent years. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">We continue to follow our long-term SAA route but do expect a few tactical changes on the way over the next few months. What we will not do is turn our back on winning by not losing by chasing risk and we will only make those lane changes, as with any good driver, when it is safe to do so.</span></p>

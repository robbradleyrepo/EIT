        <ul>
            <li><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Bought – China State Construction</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">. A Hong Kong-listed construction company which we think is well-placed to benefit from China’s infrastructure spending. While Chinese authorities are likely to pursue a moderation of growth in certain areas of the economy, we believe that it remains committed to regional infrastructure spending which is still much needed in many parts of the country. Public private partnership projects are growing strongly in China, having a significant positive impact on the company’s core earnings which rose 21% in the second half of 2016. With a stabilisation in the Hong Kong business, the company is targeting return on equity over 20% and earnings growth of 33% and 13% over the next two years. This in turn should support a 3.2% dividend yield this year, and double-digit growth in payouts forecast in 2018 and 2019.</span></li>
            <li><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Sold</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">– Supalai. </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The Thai company surprised the market by suspending its dividend and announced a warrant issuance aimed at reducing its net gearing from 88% in the 2Q17 to 60-80% range. Earnings visibility remains solid with over 80% of 2017 revenue secured but the suspension of a dividend against our expectations of a 4.4% yield has led us to switch into alternative investments which offer the combination of earnings growth and yield which we seek.</span></li>

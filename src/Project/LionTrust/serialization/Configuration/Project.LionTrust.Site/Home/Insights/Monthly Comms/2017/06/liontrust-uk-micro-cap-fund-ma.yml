        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned 3.1%* in May. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index returned 1.8%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned 3.1% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was 3.5%.</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">During the month we observed a level of share price activity for the Fund’s holdings which seemed to be at a disconnect to the underlying fundamental developments. This activity was skewed to the upside, with 15 stocks registering double-digit percentage gains, but only two falling by this amount. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Focusrite (+37.5%) – a provider of high tech audio hardware and software – &nbsp;was the largest positive contributor to the Fund in May after reporting strong interim results at the beginning of the month. The company’s revenue grew 24%, while profit before tax rose 89%. It added that it looks forward to the second half of its financial year and beyond with confidence. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">This upbeat release was offset by a statement from K3 Business Technology (-35.5%), which warned that results for the year to 30 June will be significantly below market expectations. Its interim results, released in March, were affected by contract slippages in its Enterprise division. In May, the company stated that certain large Enterprise contracts have still not been secured as expected, leading to the downgrade to guidance.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Many of the best performing portfolio holdings in May were those still benefitting from investors digesting positive corporate updates in April, including ULS Technology (+18.9%), D4t4 Solutions (+17.3%), Coretx Holding (+15.9%), Vianet (+11.9%), Charles Stanley (+11.1%) and Crimson Tide (+10.5%). </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Bioventix (+10.6%) also received a boost from the news that Siemens has launched a new test for <em>troponin</em> (a key biomarker in heart attack diagnostics) which uses Bioventix’s antibodies – resulting in product royalties for the company. Although already anticipated by the market, the company is due to lose revenues from its <em>NTproBNP</em> (a biomarker used to evaluate the severity of heart failure) test this August, having enjoyed royalties since 2004, so confirmation that a new source of revenues will be replacing it removed some uncertainty around 2017 forecast results. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Pharmaceutical marketing specialist Cello Group (+7.9%) flagged a strong start to the year in a May AGM statement, highlighting its performance in the ‘crucial’ US market. Its recent acquisition, Defined Health, has been integrated smoothly and Cello recently completed a capital raising to allow it to pursue further acquisitive growth. The company stated that it is on track to meet first half financial expectations, and that this year’s trading is likely to increase in the second half due to the timing of some key contract.&nbsp; </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Among the detractors, Sanderson Group (-9.1%) shares reacted to interim results which included a fairly cautious outlook statement. The company, which provides enterprise resource planning software into the retail sector, stated that despite the healthy economic environment, there seems to be a “slightly more considered approach from some customers”. It added that it continues to be cautious with future planning amid uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A selection of changes were made to the Fund’s portfolio in May. Next Fifteen Communications Group exited the portfolio, the culmination of a sale process triggered by the digital marketing specialist’s market capitalisation exceeding the £250m limit at which the Fund looks to make a managed exit. To stay true to its roots as a dedicated micro cap investment vehicle, the managers only consider companies with market capitalisations of under £150m for inclusion in the Fund and will look to exit holdings when they exceed £250m. Having initiated the position at 224p last March, the fund began exiting at 350p in September but managed to capture strong momentum in the shares, finally exiting it’s remaining portion this month at 420p, after this momentum appeared to have run its course. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">New positions were initiated in Cerillion and Pennant International Group. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Cerillion provides business and operational support systems primarily to the telecoms industry, via its flagship product <em>Cerillion Enterprise. </em>Once installed, the software becomes a key system for its customers, as the tasks it performs (billing, order management &amp; network planning) are critical to day to day operations. The <em>Economic Advantage</em> process only invests in companies that possess at least one of three intangible barriers to competition; intellectual property, a strong distribution network, or high contracted recurring income. Cerillion possess the first asset within the software code, and the second given the business-critical nature of its product which is currently powering billing for 80 telecoms companies in over 40 countries, generating a large amount of ongoing support and maintenance work. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Pennant International Group, headquartered in Gloucestershire, provides equipment to the defence industry. Its main products are highly realistic simulators of pieces of capital equipment (such as tanks) which military colleges and departments of defence use in training programs. Pennant possesses skills in hardware and software engineering, has requisite security clearance to be allowed to see the blueprints of the systems it emulates, and once installed these systems can generate service revenues for many years. For example, it’s been providing training on the Augusta Westland helicopter for over thirty years. It’s rich in intellectual property, has very strong customer relationships and operates in an industry with high barriers to entry. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Positive contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify;">Focusrite (+37.5%), ULS Technology (+18.9%), D4T4 Solutions (+17.3%), Coretx Holdings (+15.9%) and Empresaria Group (+14.8%).</p>

        <strong>For investment professionals only</strong><br />
        <br />
        The Liontrust UK Growth Fund returned -0.8%* in October compared with the 0.6% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.<br />
        <br />
        The Brexit saga has clearly had another chapter added to it since 31 October, but throughout October the focus was on Theresa May&rsquo;s indication that Article 50 would be triggered no later than March 2017, and the growing talk of &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo;. This contributed to a 4.2% trade-weighted depreciation of sterling. The implications for imported inflation appear to be reflected in government bond markets where the UK 10 year gilt yield rose 50bps to 1.25%. On the last day of the month, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney confirmed he would stay on in the position until June 2019, quashing rumours that recent events would prompt him to depart earlier.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;At the time of writing, US election risk is beginning to be realised. In October, markets had moved to price in a higher chance of a Trump victory, as his campaign showed resilience in the face of a series of scandals. The VIX index of volatility on US equities spiked at the end of month as the FBI stated it was reviewing newly discovered emails from Clinton&rsquo;s stint as Secretary of State. However, one of the busiest months on record in terms of US merger &amp; acquisition activity suggests that the US corporate sector was relatively sanguine regarding political risk. Deals worth over US$500bn were proposed globally in October, of which US$329m related to US companies (source: Dealogic).<br />
        <br />
        Although UK economic data continues to show little immediate negative effect from the referendum result (the September Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Index showed the biggest monthly rise in two years), the IMF continued to forecast negative consequences, cutting its forecast for UK growth for the second time since the vote. It now expects 1.1% expansion in 2017, down from the 1.3% it forecast in July.<br />
        <br />
        Encouraged by the tailwinds of weak sterling and stabilising commodity prices, the FTSE100 Index returned 1.0% in October, comparing very favourably against the FTSE 250 Index&rsquo;s -1.7% performance and the FTSE Small-Cap&rsquo;s 0.1% return. The level of this performance differential was a headwind to the Fund given its underweight position in large-caps relative to the FTSE All-Share Index and commensurately higher mid and small-cap allocations. Areas such as basic materials and financials (driven by the banks) led the large-cap index higher. This trend negatively affected the Fund&rsquo;s relative performance, but the impact was limited by the holdings in oil &amp; gas majors: BP (+7.5%) and Royal Dutch Shell (+5.9%).<br />
        <br />
        Not all oil &amp; gas sector holdings fared so well. Industry support services group Amec Foster Wheeler (-21.7%) was the Fund&rsquo;s worst performing holding in October. While it stated that 2016 and 2017 trading expectations are unchanged, its failure to upgrade its oil &amp; gas division outlook in light of recovering spot prices may have ranked as a small disappointment for some investors. However, the majority of investor unease will have stemmed from the revelation that new management has yet to finish its analysis of the company&rsquo;s optimal capital structure, a delay which caused it to cancel a &lsquo;capital markets day&rsquo; update planned for November.<br />
        <br />
        The Fund&rsquo;s other biggest detractors in October moved lower without any specific newsflow catalyst.<br />
        <br />
        A statement from PageGroup (+8.0%) in October painted a strong picture of the post-referendum dynamics experienced by many companies with significant international operations. Although fragile domestic conditions led the recruiter to flag a 4.7% fall in UK gross profit within its Q3 trading statement, the group total rose 14.1% in reported terms to &pound;159m. The positive impact of weaker sterling amounted to &pound;17.8m, or 12.8percentage points; constant currency growth in gross profits was 1.3%. The company estimates a further positive currency effect of &pound;19m at the gross profit level in Q4 if exchange rates at the time of the announcement persist.<br />
        <br />
        RWS Holdings (+14.1%) is a provider of patent translation and other intellectual property support services. The company announced it has enjoyed its &ldquo;best year ever&rdquo; with revenues to be at least &pound;122m, up some 28% from 2015. Last year it completed the transformational deal to acquire US based CTi, a provider of linguistic validation in the life sciences niche. The deal has proven well-timed given the predominantly dollar based revenues CTi contributes.<br />

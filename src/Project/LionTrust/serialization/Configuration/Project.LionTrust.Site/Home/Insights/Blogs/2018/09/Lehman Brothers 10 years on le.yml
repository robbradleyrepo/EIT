        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The ‘dash for trash’ bouts of risk-seeking investor behaviour in 2012 and 2013 saw sharp gains for sectors such as banks, which didn’t meet our investment criteria. While this was painful in terms of short-term performance at the time, one of the key lessons we learnt was to stick to our process and be resilient to pressure – refusing to bend our criteria in order to capture short-term trends. This approach has subsequently paid off handsomely.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>We’ve learnt that when central bankers say they will “do whatever it takes”, as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi did when he promised to save the euro, they mean it. Moreover they are grudgingly prepared to turn a blind eye to the unintended consequences of their actions, and would no doubt do it all again!</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>We now have a generation of fund managers who <em>haven’t</em> been able to learn the lessons from the GFC themselves by investing through it. This cohort has enjoyed very benign investment conditions created by central banks, so we have a preference for managers who have battle scars and experience of more than just a decade-long bull market. </span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>For Europe, the central bank initially made a bad situation worse by raising interest rates in 2011 under ECB Chairman Trichet. Under Mario Draghi, the ECB has been much more proactive in attempting to defuse the crisis and force the European banking sector to prepare for the next one by repairing balance sheets. The key lesson learned for the ECB is that there needs to be a lender of last resort for every financial system to underwrite confidence in the case of market failure. As the ECB has increased its potential liabilities therefore, it has also increased its level of supervision, gaining the power of life and death over troubled banks. </span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>In the ten years since Lehman’s collapse, we have seen a fundamental shift in the expectations of companies from both investors and customers. It’s now routine to question a board’s gender balance and corporate culture. As fund managers, our own investors increasingly require we state how we engage with investee companies on material issues and the wider risks they pose. We welcome this shift with open arms – asking these kinds of questions can really improve our understanding of companies’ ability to produce sustainable returns.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Although the GFC had a large impact on Asian markets, the biggest lessons were actually learnt a decade earlier in the late-90s Asian Financial Crisis (AFC). As a result of this painful experience, Asia was far less reliant on foreign capital by 2008, and suffered less from the GFC than it otherwise would have. The emergence of China obviously helped in this respect.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>During times of crisis, it is more important than ever to focus on the power of process. The GFC reinforced our conviction to not get distracted by panic in the market but rather, to stick to a tried and tested investment method. Our investment process concentrates on cash flow instead of P&amp;L earnings which can be manipulated by companies to look better than they actually are. Cash flow doesn’t lie. In a more volatile market environment, such as the GFC, it is more important than ever to implement the process in a rigorous, consistent and disciplined way.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The primary lesson should be one of humility under conditions of uncertainty. As is human nature, bankers were overconfident, mistaking abstract financial models for concrete truths. Overconfidence combined with overleverage was a toxic mix in 2008. Banks now look more humble. Regulatory pressure has seen balance sheets shrink and capital buffers grow; high quality assets assuaging liquidity concerns. </span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Matt McLoughlin, Head of Trading </span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Liquidity has now become such an important factor for asset managers when constructing portfolios.&nbsp;During the period while Lehman Brothers was in danger of collapse but still functioning, the ability to trade assets without affecting its market price varied depending on the level of distress in the market.&nbsp; Less liquid assets became extremely hard to sell and trading them caused a large negative market impact.&nbsp; Nowadays liquidity is one of the main factors that institutional asset managers focus on so that they can easily trade in and out of assets at sensible prices.</span></p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>There are currently signs of hot conditions in credit markets with, for example, covenants extremely weak and leveraged buy-out (LBO’s) financings with very high levels of debt. I would say these characteristics are true of any late cycle period. However, I do not believe conditions in credit markets are in the pre-2008 realm. Although there were many examples of awful lending standards, the GFC was caused by leveraged vehicles buying leveraged investments and banks having miniscule levels of capital to be able to absorb the losses that were amplified by that leverage. Combine this with the level of interbank lending and lack of liquidity, and the financial system found itself in dire straits. Today, banks have a lot more capital.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>I am now often asked whether China’s current debt levels could spark its own crisis. We acknowledge that China has grown its debt too quickly, but the aggregate debt levels are misleading as they largely constitute loans from government controlled entities, to government controlled entities. This is by no means ideal, but it does mean that an imminent financial crisis is pretty unlikely.</span></p>

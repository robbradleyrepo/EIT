        <strong>For investment professionals only</strong><br />
        <br />
        The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned 0.1%* in October. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap excluding investment trusts Index returned -1.8%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned 0.5% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was -1.7%.<br />
        <br />
        The concept of &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo; gained some credence in October which, when combined with Theresa May&rsquo;s indication of Article 50 notification by March 2017, contributed to a further slide in the value of the pound. Trade-weighted sterling depreciated by 4.2% in the month. This contributed to a strong performance from UK large-caps, the FTSE100 rising 1.0%, but lower down the capitalisation scale it was a weak month for equities.<br />
        <br />
        In such an environment, newsflow proved again to be the catalyst for outperformance, with the portfolio&rsquo;s three top contributors enjoying a trio of forecast upgrades.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>
        Bioventix </strong>(+26.3%), which develops and supplies sheep monoclonal antibodies to the global clinical diagnostics market, posted preliminary results for the year to 30 June which showed 27% revenue growth and 35% growth in profit before tax. Figures were flattered by a currency tailwind, as the company&rsquo;s global royalty revenues (c.75% of turnover) are largely denominated in US$ and euros. Upgrades to current year earnings-per-share and a 20p special dividend served to sweeten the news further for investors.<br />
        <br />
        Manufacturer of industrial fasteners <strong>Trifast</strong> (+16.0%) also sells its products across the globe and was a beneficiary of the weak pound. In a trading update for the half year to September, the company reported continuing solid organic growth and positive trading momentum, giving analysts the confidence to lock in FX-related upgrades for the full year.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>
        CML Microsystems</strong> (+14.6%), a designer and manufacturer of semiconductors for the niche industrial storage and communication markets, was the third company to positively surprise on earnings in a trading update for its own half year to September. First half sales at the group rose by 18% and profit before tax jumped 30% including a two-month benefit from recently-acquired Chinese semiconductor provider Sicomm, a performance which the house broker commented was &ldquo;more than on track&rdquo; to achieve original forecast estimates. Boosted further by a healthy net cash position, the shares moved sharply ahead.<br />
        <br />
        Elsewhere, the Fund&rsquo;s largest holding, market research company <strong>YouGov</strong> (+9.1%), released preliminary results showing significant progress on growing its higher margin, more scalable Data Products and Services revenue streams, which now account for 38% of group revenue and contribute 58% of adjusted operating profit. Overall, revenue grew 16% and adjusted profit before tax leapt 46% during the year to July, a result which was again helped by currency translation benefit from the depreciation of sterling as over 70% of YouGov&rsquo;s revenue is generated outside the UK.<br />
        <br />
        The heaviest newsflow-driven detractor from the Fund&rsquo;s performance during October was geospatial data software and services specialist <strong>1Spatial</strong> (-33.3%). The company released interim results to July which showed a 60% increase in revenue (aided by the acquisition of Enables IT last year) but a 67% reduction in adjusted EBITDA as contract delays hit the timing of revenue recognition in its higher margin core Geospatial division. Although the house broker maintained guidance for the full year, the market was spooked by a now-heavy H2 weighting to the forecasts, as well as a halving in the company&rsquo;s net cash balance over the half year.<br />
        <br />
        The remainder of the negative contributors to performance were largely driven by market sentiment rather than specific company news. Patent and trade mark attorney group <strong>Murgitroyd</strong> (-10.9%) saw its shares slide due to prolonged retail selling pressure. The move came after the group reported preliminary results in September, explaining that growth in its North American business had been offsetting weaker market conditions in the UK and Europe &ndash; news which last month left its shares trading broadly flat. Wealth management group <strong>Charles&nbsp;Stanley </strong>(-14.9%) slipped back as concerns about wider market uncertainty and the group&rsquo;s ability to execute on<br />
        its wealth manager remuneration overhaul came back to the fore. Telematics solutions provider <strong>Quartix</strong> (-18.0%) sharply retraced its recent bull run, demonstrating a more &ldquo;risk-off&rdquo; appetite from investors during the month which left some more highly-rated stocks vulnerable to a reversal.<br />
        <br />
        Ruggedised electronics specialist<strong> Solid State</strong> (-13.9%) came under pressure despite releasing a trading update&nbsp;for the half year to September which confirmed performance in line with full year expectations. The group&nbsp;reported that recent acquisitions were performing well and that underlying trading was ahead of the equivalent&nbsp;period last year. However, after enjoying a sustained rise throughout the summer, the shares sold off as&nbsp;investors fretted about weakening demand conditions across the broader UK industrial spectrum.<br />
        <br />
        Conversely, defence-focused engineering and technology business <strong>Cohort</strong> (+11.1%) rallied after it announced&nbsp;the decision to close one of its divisions and integrate its activities into other subsidiaries within the group. The&nbsp;exceptional cost of closure of the underperforming division will be offset by ongoing net annual cost savings and&nbsp;by a solid recent trading performance, leaving forecasts largely unchanged. Later in the month, news of a &pound;12m&nbsp;nine-year extension contract win to provide managed IT services to the Sentry Whole Life Support Programme&nbsp;at RAF Waddington helped cement the share price gains.<br />

        Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Investment in the Fund carries the risk of potential total&nbsp;loss of capital. Some smaller companies may be less liquid than larger companies and the price swings in smaller&nbsp;company funds may therefore be greater than in larger company funds.

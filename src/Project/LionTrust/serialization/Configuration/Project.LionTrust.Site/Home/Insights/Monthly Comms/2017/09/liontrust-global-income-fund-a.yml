        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund returned 2.6%* in sterling terms in August compared with the 1.5% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</strong></p>
        <p>The MSCI World Index rose 2.5% in August in sterling terms, boosted by the currency&rsquo;s decline (-2.6% in trade weighted terms). The pound dropped as the Bank of England lowered its economic growth forecasts for the UK in its August meeting and its rate setting committee voted 6-2 to keep interest rates on hold, compared to 5-3 in its previous meeting in June. When measured in local currency, the MSCI World Index returned a more modest 0.2%.</p>
        <p>Geopolitical tension between the US and North Korea weighed on investors&rsquo; minds in August. North Korea&rsquo;s missile testing sparked a war of words between the two countries&rsquo; volatile leaders. Trump warned that North Korea would be met with &ldquo;fire and fury like the world has never seen&rdquo; while North Korea responded by suggesting Kim Jong Un was considering a strike on US territory of Guam. The escalation in hostility between the two leaders hurt global equities and propped up safe havens such as gold, which rose 4.1% in August. </p>
        <p>The Fund&rsquo;s good performance in August was partly attributable to its selections in the financials sector &ndash; one of the Fund&rsquo;s largest sector exposures and one of the few areas where we found evidence of substantial dispersion in valuations during this year&rsquo;s annual review process. There were notable returns from <strong>Deutsche Pfandbriefbank </strong>(+9.3%) and <strong>RMB Holdings </strong>(+8.7%). Deutsche Pfandbriefbank&rsquo;s pre-tax profit for the second quarter of 2017 rose by more than 30% year-on-year, resulting in it stating that profit for the full-year will be at the upper end or above previous guidance. </p>
        <p>The Fund also has a significant weighting to materials stocks, and here it participated in the sector rally. The MSCI World materials sector rose 4.2% on the month, tracking commodity prices higher including steel, which rose almost 8%. Russian steel maker <strong>Severstal </strong>(+17.7%) and London-listed miner <strong>Rio Tinto </strong>(+9.0%) were among those to produce strong returns.</p>
        <p><strong>Lukoil </strong>(+10.4%) was another top contributor after the oil &amp; gas company published first half results which came in above consensus forecasts, with profit up 91% year-on-year. Lukoil&rsquo;s profit was inflated by a positive foreign exchange effect on the US$1.45bn sale of its JSC Arkhangelskgeoldobycha business during the period. </p>
        <p>The biggest detractors from the Fund also reported results. <strong>Big 5 Sporting Goods Corp&rsquo;s</strong> (-25.8%) second quarter earnings per share fell short of analyst estimates. The company guided towards same store sales in the third quarter that will be in the negative low single digit range. Oil producer <strong>Fred Olsen Energy&rsquo;s </strong>(-17.5%) second quarter loss was above analysts&rsquo; estimates, though its revenue and EBITDA both beat forecasts. Australian electricals retailer <strong>JB Hi-Fi </strong>(-7.2%) fell despite reporting upbeat full-year results, which came ahead of the market. Total sales rose 42% year-on-year for the 12 months to end June to AU$5.6bn, while underlying EBIT rose 39%. The company guided sales in the current financial year to be around AU$6.8bn.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Severstal (+17.7%), Energias de Portugal (+10.6%) and Lukoil (+10.4%).<strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Big 5 Sporting Goods Corp (-25.8%), Fred Olsen Energy (-17.5%) and JB Hi-Fi (-7.2%).</p>

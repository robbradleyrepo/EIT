        <p><strong>The Fund returned -3.1%* in sterling terms in November, compared with the -1.6% return from the MSCI Europe ex-UK index. </strong></p>
        <p>The month started off with a flurry of central bank news, with the Bank of England raising rates for the first time in over a decade to 0.5%, while US President Donald Trump announced that Jerome Powell will be the next Federal Reserve chair. There were also some complications with Germany&rsquo;s leadership as coalition talks between Angela Merkel&rsquo;s CDU party and the Free Democrats broke down, keeping investors on their toes.</p>
        <p>However for most of the month, the focus was very much on corporate earnings. The MSCI Europe ex-UK Index experienced its biggest monthly fall of the year so far. Weakness in European equities was largely broad based, though cyclical areas appeared to underperform the most, with consumer discretionary (-2.9%), industrials (-2.8%) and IT (-2.6%) sectors the biggest fallers in sterling terms. The sole sector to gain this month was real estate (+2.1%). </p>
        <p>The Fund&rsquo;s holdings in cyclical areas contributed to its underperformance, with disappointing stock returns both news driven - <strong>Vestas Wind Systems </strong>(-33.7%) and <strong>Peab </strong>(-9.0%) - and sentiment related - <strong>Peugeot </strong>(-14.4%) and <strong>JM</strong> (-14.3%).</p>
        <p>Vestas Wind Systems was the largest detractor during the month. The wind turbine manufacturer lowered its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin guidance for 2017 to 12%-13% from 12%-14% while free cash flow guidance was cut to between &euro;450m-&euro;900m, having earlier been set at a minimum of &euro;700m. The company stated that the lower guidance reflected uncertainty around the US market, additional execution costs and an increasingly competitive environment. Due to the deterioration in Vestas&rsquo;s cash flow characteristics, we sold it from the Fund. In addition, we also exited positions in Orion and Lenzing following negative developments in investment screen scores.</p>
        <p>Austrian textile company, <strong>Lenzing </strong>(-13.7%), reported a 9.4% annual rise in the first nine months of the year to &euro;1.73bn while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 23.9% to &euro;397m. However, Chief Executive Stefan Doboczky stated while operating results in 2017 are set to be an improvement from 2016, there will be more headwinds in 2018.</p>
        <p><strong>Subsea 7 </strong>(-14.4%) and Peab both reported third quarter results which disappointed the market. Seabed-to-surface engineer Subsea 7&rsquo;s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at US$250m, below the market expectation of US$275m. The company, however, maintained its outlook for the full-year in which it expects revenue growth to be higher year-on-year but adjusted EBITDA margins to be lower compared to the record levels in 2016. Nordic construction and engineering group Peab reported net sales of SEK11.6bn, falling just short of the consensus estimate of SEK11.7bn, though profit before tax came in slightly ahead. Management maintained a positive outlook, referencing a solid order backlog and a good project mix. However, they warned of challenges including capacity limitations, increases in subcontractor costs and rising land prices.<span> </span></p>
        <p>Despite a tough market backdrop, there were a number of holdings which ended the month higher. Cosmetics company <strong>Oriflame Holding </strong>(+7.8%) was the biggest gainer after it reported upbeat results for the third quarter of 2017. EBITDA rose 30% year-on-year to &euro;40m, beating analyst expectations of &euro;35.5m. Sales of &euro;295m in the third quarter also came in ahead of the market&rsquo;s forecast of &euro;294m, representing a 6% improvement from the previous year. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included: </strong></p>
        <p>Liberbank (+16.2%), Oriflame Holding (+7.8%) and Mediobanca (+7.4%). </p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included: </strong></p>
        <p>Vestas Wind Systems (-33.7%), Peugeot (-14.4%) and Subsea 7 (-14.4%).</p>

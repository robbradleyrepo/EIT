        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p><p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: justify;">The Fund’s A5 share class returned -1.7%* in euro terms in May (A4 share class -1.8%). This compares with the 1.0% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index.</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;">European markets’ positive return in May led the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index to a new all-time high. On the political front, Emmanuel Macron achieved a convincing victory in the French election over far-right rival Marine Le Pen. Opinion polls for the general election in the UK tightened, with Theresa May’s substantial lead over Jeremy Corbyn eroding, causing sterling to weaken.</p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;"><br></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;"></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: left;">Market confidence in the </span><em style="font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: left;">Trump Trade</em><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: left;"> wavered as the president came under increasing scrutiny. Trump unexpectedly fired FBI Director James Comey amid an investigation into the president’s ties with Russia. Comey later leaked a memo detailing Trump’s request to halt an investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynn. These developments took some impetus out of the equity market rally, but the S&amp;P 500 still returned 1.4% over May. Nervousness was more apparent in currency markets, with the US dollar hitting its lowest level - in trade weighted terms - since Trump’s election in November last year.</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: left;"><br></span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;">Opec struck a deal to extend its production cuts to the end of March 2018 in an attempt to prop up the price of oil. The agreement - first made in November last year - was subsequently endorsed by Russia and other non-Opec members. Oil prices had started the month poorly, with Brent touching its lowest level of the year so far at US$46.6 a barrel. As Opec members indicated an extension to production curbs was on the cards, Brent rallied around 8% from that low but still ended the month 2.7% lower. The MSCI Europe Index’s energy sector rose 0.6% in euro terms over the month.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;">Although ongoing political uncertainty failed to prevent a continuation of equity markets’ steady drift higher, we did observe a reversal of last month’s sector trends with cyclicals underperforming, while defensive sectors drove the gains. Utilities was the best performing sector (+7.0%) in the MSCI Europe Index, followed by telecoms (+6.1%), and consumer staples (+3.7%). The biggest sector detractors were materials (-2.7%), consumer discretionary (-1.8%) and financials (-1.5%). The Fund’s bias towards cyclical sectors was therefore a headwind in May.</p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;"><br></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;">The materials sector particularly weighed on the Fund’s performance, with Evraz (-15.3%) the worst performing holding. The steel maker, which also has a coal arm, was hurt by the fall in the metallurgical coal price as supply came back online following the disruption from Cyclone Debbie in Australia. </p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;"><br></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;">Shipping and logistics company DFDS (-10.1%) disappointed the market with its first quarter results, with both revenue and adjusted EBITDA falling below Bloomberg consensus figures. However, DFDS maintained its outlook for 4% full-year revenue growth. </p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;"><br></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;">Among the contributors to the Fund, Scandic Hotels Group (+8.5%) was one of the most prominent. The Nordic hotel operator reported a 19.3% year-on-year rise in net sales in the first quarter of 2017, boosted by the timing of Easter. The group also noted that even excluding the impact of Easter, it still achieved double-digit sales growth.</p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;"><br></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;">In keeping with the Cashflow Solution investment process, May saw the implementation of changes to the portfolio resulting from our annual review of companies’ reports and accounts. This review includes a forensic analysis of companies’ historic cash flows and balance sheet developments. We apply a simple quantitative screen using two measures of cash flow to create a composite ranking of the universe of companies, with only the top 20% qualifying for further qualitative analysis. We then apply additional ‘secondary’ scores which further distil down the universe to what we believe are the best types of investment opportunity the top quintile of cash flow will offer.</p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;"><br></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;">In this year’s review we initiated positions in: AG Barr, Brembo, Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles, Dassault Aviation, Deutsche Pfandbriefbank, Diploma, Eurocell, Ferrexpo, Grainger, Greggs, John Laing Group, Lenzing, Liberbank, Loomis, Ringkøbing Landbobank, Scandic Hotels, SimCorp, Skandiabanken, UPM-Kymmene and Vontobel Holding. </p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;"><br></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;">The following holdings were sold: AMG Advanced Metallurgical, Axfood, Banco BPM, Bobst Group, Burford Capital, CIE Automotive, Duni, Forbo Holding, JD Sport Fashion, Kardex, Kudelski, Nexans, NKT Holding, Royal Unibrew, Tullow Oil and Vossloh. </p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;"><br></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;">Following the review, the Fund continues to have a bias towards growth stoc<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">ks, though there are still selective value opportunities available. We characterise these value opportunities as ‘recovering value’ (companies that are reining in capex and tightly managing working capital in order to aid financial recovery) rather than ‘contrarian value’ (companies suffering a prolonged period of poor trading; may be restructuring or selling off assets). We remain very wary of stocks scoring well on ‘contrarian value’ measures as these companies tend to perform poorly in environments when investor anxiety is very low, as it is currently.</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; background: white; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></p>

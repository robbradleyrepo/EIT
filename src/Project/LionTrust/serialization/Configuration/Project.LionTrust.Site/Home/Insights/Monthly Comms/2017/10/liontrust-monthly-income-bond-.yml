        <p><strong>For professional investors only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Following a strong first half of 2017, the Fund slightly lagged its benchmark in Q3, registering returns of 0.18% against 0.32% from the iBoxx Sterling Corporates 5-15 Years Index *. &nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Performance drivers were similar to trends from the first half, namely stock selection within the bank, utility, insurance and telecom sectors, overall positive attribution from our sector positioning &ndash; particularly the overweight in insurance &ndash; and an underweight duration position, although this was offset by curve positioning, where we were underweight in long maturities.</p>
        <p>Over Q3, we continued to develop several of these calls, increasing the duration short as the interest rates market rallied. We also reduced the short position on US interest rates due to political concerns &ndash; primarily sabre rattling of the nuclear variety from President Trump and his Korean counterpart &ndash; and will look to increase this again as tensions ease and the focus returns to improving economic growth.</p>
        <p>Looking towards Q4 and beyond, we remain bearish on interest rates as central bank policy increasingly moves to a tightening bias. </p>
        <p>September finally gave us some certainty on this front, at least as far as the US Federal Reserve is concerned, as the Bank announced the first stage of its great unwinding plans. The Fed will start cutting its $4.5 trillion balance sheet in October, initially by $10bn per month and chair&nbsp;Janet Yellen&nbsp;said the normalisation process would be gradual and predictable.</p>
        <p>Although we expect yields to remain low in a historic context, we believe government yields will continue to normalise over the coming twelve months and negative real rates on nominal government bonds in the UK are unsustainable.</p>
        <p>We remain positive on corporate bonds, supported by strong fundamentals including strong PMIs in the UK, Europe and the US, a thriving consumer and robust housing market in America, and continued growth in Emerging Markets. In addition, the supply and demand backdrop is also positive for the asset class.</p>
        <p>The Fund remains overweight insurance names and, to a lesser extent, banks on relative valuations and we also continue to deploy protection strategies as we look to reduce volatility.</p>

Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The issue of units/shares in Liontrust Funds may be subject to an initial charge, which will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term. Investments should always be considered as long term. &bull; Any decision to invest should be always based on the final Prospectus and Key Investor Information Documents (KIIDs) and you should take independent legal advice if necessary. These documents contain important information which should be read before investing in any fund and they can be obtained, free of charge, <a href="http://www.liontrust.co.uk/what-we-offer/fund-literature">here</a>.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"> &bull; The Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. The funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates.&nbsp; The funds invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions, it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the bonds held by these funds. The funds can invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against fluctuations in currencies, credit risk and interests rates or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions.</p>

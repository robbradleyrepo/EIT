        <p><strong><span>We have written over recent weeks that, in a world where much seems right – at least in terms of markets – there are three reasons to be nervous: trade tariffs, the end of quantitative easing (QE) and concern about debt downgrades in Italy.</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>With August drawing to a close and many people returning from holidays, these appear to be biting: markets are getting jittery and volatility is spiking, with weak emerging markets (EMs) a symptom of poor trade policy and tightening monetary policy. In light of our three concerns, our funds currently have no EM, no Italy and we are reining back credit risk.</span></p>
        <p><span>On the QE front, as easy money is withdrawn from the system, traditional dollar borrowers are coming under pressure and EMs are in the crosshairs. Amid Turkey’s current troubles, </span><span>the country’s central bank deputy governor Erkan Kilimci is leaving his role </span><span>and the currency has fallen back to within 5% of its all-time low. In Argentina meanwhile, the country has raised rates from 45% to 60% in an attempt to defend the peso.</span></p>
        <p><span>This combination has spooked all EMs and we are happy to remain zero weighted, particularly with a new set of tweets from President Trump suggesting $200bn of new tariffs on Chinese goods weighing further on sentiment.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">US markets, which had largely ignored EM weakness to that point, dropped on this China chat.</span></p>
        <p><span>Elsewhere, we may see further ratings agency action on Italian debt, of the “not good” kind – and although the country’s 10-year bonds now yield well over 3%, that is something else we are happy to avoid.</span></p>
        <span>Overall, next week looks crucial to determine short-term direction: markets look expensive, a correction is overdue and I for one would welcome that.<br></span>

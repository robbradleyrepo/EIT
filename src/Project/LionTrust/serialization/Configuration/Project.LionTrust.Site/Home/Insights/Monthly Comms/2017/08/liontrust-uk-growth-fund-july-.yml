        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Growth Fund returned -0.5%* in July compared with the 1.2% return from the FTSE All-Share Index. </strong></p>
        <p>July was a broadly positive month for UK equities. The mid and small cap end of the market once again outperformed large caps with the FTSE 250 and FTSE Small Cap indices returning 2.4% and 2.2% respectively, compared to the FTSE 100 Index’s 0.9% return. The blue-chip index’s returns were held back by an appreciation in the pound versus the dollar, as the greenback resumed its recent declines due to reduced confidence in President Trump’s ability to implement his reflationary policies and soft US macro data. This in turn weighed on the FTSE 100’s dollar earning constituents. </p>
        <p>Oil prices rebounded from recent weakness helping the FTSE All-Share’s oil &amp; gas sector deliver a total return of 3.2%. Moreover, improvements in metal prices – copper prices reaching two year highs and iron ore prices touching three month highs – drove gains in the materials sector (+11.2%). We hold no stocks in the materials sector, meaning we missed out on this rally. However, we maintain our avoidance of the sector because in our view miners’ values are derived from tangible assets (minerals in the ground x market price), not the intangible assets which our investment process seeks out.</p>
        <p>Among individual stock movers, <strong>Indivior </strong>(+22.8%) was a notable contributor after it raised its full-year guidance in its interim results, reflecting strong US market conditions and lower expenses. The drugmaker now expects net revenue in the range of US$1.09bn-US$1.12bn, up from US$1.05bn-US$1.08bn and net income to be between US$265m-US$285m from US$200m-US$220m. In the first half of 2017, Indivior reported a 4% year-on-year increase in net revenue to US$553m. </p>
        <p>However, news in UK pharma was dominated by <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> (-11.0%) which fell sharply after its Imfinzi drug failed to meet the primary endpoint for progression-free survival. Meanwhile, <strong>British American Tobacco </strong>(-9.9%) was part of a sector wide sell off in tobacco stocks after the US Food and Drug Administration announced that it will target nicotine levels in cigarettes in a bid to curb addiction. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, drinks giant <strong>Diageo’s</strong> (+7.9%) shares appreciated after its full-year results were released at the end of July. It reported a 15% annual rise in net sales and 25% increase in underlying operating profit for the year to end of June. The company’s board also approved a £1.5bn share buyback and raised its total dividend by 5%. <strong>StatPro Group </strong>(+15.6%) stated in a short update that trading in the first half of 2017 was in line with its expectations and that the integration of UBS Delta was progressing well. </p>
        <p><strong>Renishaw’s </strong>(+15.2%) final results were well received by the market. The company, which provides precision enhancing products to medical diagnostics, machine calibration and neurosurgery markets, reported record revenue of £537m for the year to end June, up 26% from the same time last year. Adjusted pre-tax profit rose 25% and its total dividend was raised by 8% to 52p. Sir David McMurtry, chairman and CEO of the company, said he expects another year of growth despite Brexit uncertainties</p>
        <p>Investment management company <strong>Brooks MacDonald </strong>(-14.8%) fell after newly installed CEO Catherine Connellan announced the company was set to see increasing costs due to upcoming additional regulation, to the detriment of margins, as well as unhelpfully revealing a £6.5m charge related to legacy matters from its former Channel Islands-based Spearpoint business. On the positive side, the group noted that its capital position remains strong as it recording a 26% annual rise in funds under management at the end of June. </p>
        <p><strong>Domino’s Pizza Group’s </strong>(-9.4%) interim underlying pre-tax profit rose 9.1% year-on-year as revenue rose by 20%. However, the market was disappointed by UK like-for-like sales growth of 2.4% in the 26 weeks to 25 June. This was down sharply from the 13.0% growth seen in the same period the year before.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included:</strong></p>
        <p>Indivior (+22.8%), StatPro Group (+15.6%), Renishaw (+15.2%), RWS Holdings (+11.4%) and Diageo (+7.9%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Brooks MacDonald (-14.8%), AstraZeneca (-11.0%), British American Tobacco (-9.9%), Domino’s Pizza Group (-9.4%) and Aggreko (-7.8%).</p>

        <p> • Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</p>

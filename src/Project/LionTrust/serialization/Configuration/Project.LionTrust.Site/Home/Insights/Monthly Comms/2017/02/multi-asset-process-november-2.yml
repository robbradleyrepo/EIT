        <strong>For investment professionals only<br></strong><p><strong><br>
        </strong>November was dominated by Donald Trump as the controversial Republican nominee won the White House and the US chose not to elect its first female leader.<br><br>
        Ahead of Trump's inauguration on 20 January next year, investors are attempting to guess where he will focus policy - not an easy task as his campaigning included more pledges than could be implemented during a term in the White House. That said, dominant themes seem to be trade, immigration and infrastructure spend within an overall reflationary policy of investment and cutting taxes.<br><br>
        This points to the winners being companies generating domestic earnings, mainly to be found in the small-cap space.<br><br>
        While the result came as a shock, investors are coming to expect the unexpected in 2016 and immediately after the month ended, Italy decided to reject prime minister Renzi’s plans for constitutional reform. Fears over what potential problems in Italy might mean had already caused tremors heading into December and with Renzi resigning after his defeat, markets will have another bout of uncertainty to digest.<br><br>
        Overall, global equities were up over November in dollar terms while bond markets weakened. Within that, US equities were solid, with economically sensitive sectors leading the rally in anticipation of Trump’s tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending. Elsewhere, European markets were slightly down as political risk came to the fore, while the UK posted its first negative month since May.<br><br>
        Sterling strengthened during November following a High Court ruling that the government must seek parliamentary approval before triggering Article 50. Rising gilt yields drove a rotation away from more defensive bond proxy sectors towards more cyclical areas of the market, while financials and mining were beneficiaries of Trump’s reflationary rhetoric.<br><br>
        In terms of our portfolios, we did not feel it necessary to move aggressively ahead of the US election as we already see US equities as expensive. The early reaction was reminiscent of what happened post-Brexit but the lesson we took from that was not to read too much into the short-term response to political events. Brexit panic represented an opportunity for bargain-hunting active managers and I suspect this may happen again.<br><br>
        Meanwhile, we highlighted earlier this month what we see as a key shift in the bond market, with rising yields suggesting the bubble may have finally burst. We have seen yields back up before only to resume their multi-year bull trend but the asset class now looks one of the most expensive ever and it seems likely we have reached an inflexion point.<br><br>
        Growing populism around the world is currently driving bond yields in the same direction globally but we believe it will eventually cause greater heterogeneity of returns. If countries introduce frictions to international trade and the movement of capital and labour, then their economies are likely to diverge and the debt of each country will be assessed on the merits of its own economy. This is one reason we will be taking a more international approach to our fixed income allocation.<br><br>We have maintained our longstanding underweight but the diversification benefits continue to justify an allocation in a balanced portfolio. Investors now have to look to other means of generating income and low-volatility returns, with the options including real estate, long/short equity strategies and strategic bond funds.<br>

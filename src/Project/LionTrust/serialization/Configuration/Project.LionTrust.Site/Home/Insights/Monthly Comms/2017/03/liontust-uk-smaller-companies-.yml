        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned 2.2%* in February, compared with the 0.9% return from the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index.</strong></span></p>
        <p>February was another busy month for newsflow as Fund holdings issued a raft of results statements and trading updates.</p>
        <p>The largest positive share price reaction came from Quartix (+32.1%), which supplies vehicle telematics and services. The scale of the rally reflects not only a solid set of full year results, but also a growing appreciation of the benefits of its re-focus towards high quality recurring fleet revenue growth at the expense of low margin, low visibility business on the insurance side. Some investors were initially unsure about this change of emphasis and its share price softened following its January trading update, which we covered in last month’s Fund review. However, long term investors who have been willing to stick with the company are now being rewarded for their patience. Full year results revealed a 19% rise in revenues to £23.3m as good growth in the second half of its fiscal year led to a 16% increase in its customer base (to 9,105) and a 19% rise in subscription units (to 87,889).</p>
        <p>Investors also responded well to final results from Globaldata (+11.8%) which were ahead of market forecasts. The company reported 65% growth in revenues, to top £100m for the first time. It was a transformational year for the group, as it integrated two acquisitions in the consumer and healthcare verticals, rebranding the group to create a “leading global business information company”. Likewise Animalcare (+19.5%), the veterinary medicine supplier, released results – for the interim period –that were ahead of expectations. This strength was driven primarily by the group’s largest division, Licensed Veterinary Medicines, which grew by over 17% on a like for like basis. The division saw healthy demand for existing medicines from both domestic and export markets, and also benefitted from the launch of four new products during the period.</p>
        <p>Ideagen’s (+16.4%) interim results were also well received. The provider of governance, risk and compliance software reported underlying organic revenue growth of 16%, which was boosted to 22% on the inclusion of recent acquisitions, Covalent Software &amp; Logen. These also added to the company’s recurring revenue base, now sitting at 56% of total revenues (equivalent to 90% of fixed costs). Progress in its cloud business remains encouraging with over 40 new clients added in the period, as does its retention of existing clients – the company reported a 98% renewal rate for maintenance and support contracts. </p>
        <p>Trading updates were less kind to the Fund’s holdings, as Tracsis (-28.4%), Plexus Holdings (-14.6%) and Arbuthnot Banking Group (-9.2%) lost ground on the back of statements.</p>
        <p>An interim trading update from Tracsis indicated that activity will be significantly skewed to the second half of its year and also subject to the “timely conversion of new sales” for the group’s software products and services. As ever, the market was unimpressed by the increased uncertainty and investors responded by increasing the risk discount applied to the shares. Having recovered sharply during January as investors took some contract wins as evidence of green shoots within its end oil &amp; gas markets, Plexus Holdings’ statement led to it giving back some ground in February. Although the tone was undoubtedly negative, stating that revenues are “materially behind expectations for the current financial year”, CEO Ben Van Bilderbeek did give some cause for optimism: in his view “the bottom of the cycle has now been reached”. Arbuthnot Banking Group issued a short full year trading update toward the end of the month, stating that pre-tax profits were in line with expectations and also disclosing the purchase of a portfolio of loans from Duncan Lawrie. The news, while positive in tone, was not enough to sustain the upward trajectory enjoyed in January.</p>
        <p>Keywords Studios (+15.2%) benefitted from increased investor appetite following a new broker initiation early in the month which highlighted its attractions as a key consolidator in its sector. In the view of the broker, the company’s position as the largest provider of outsourced technical services to the video game industry by revenues, breadth of service offering and geographic footprint gives it “a significant competitive advantage in what remains a highly fragmented market”.</p>
        <p>Pressure Technologies (-25.8%) shares drifted off recent highs, having moved smartly north in January following indications of a brighter outlook in the company’s year-end numbers. Having suffered several difficult years in oil &amp; gas end markets, management has now ‘right-sized’ the business and positioned it to take advantage of proprietary technology in other growth areas such as alternative energy.</p>
        <p>During February, Cello Group was added to the Fund, a healthcare-focused strategic marketing group possessing strong intellectual property, and long standing customer relationships with the majority of ‘big pharma’. The Fund was able to invest via a placing during the company’s fund-raise for its acquisition of Defined Health. The Boston-based business development strategy firm has a particular focus on the biotech sector, bringing closer Cello’s goal to move the focus of its business toward the US, being the largest market for its services.</p>

        Projections of government spending and debt-to-GDP ratios are a key influence on bond yields. But what if they are wrong? David Roberts challenges some of these forecasts and highlights the bonds that could prove to be most mispriced.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="color: black;">Government bond yields in developed economies reflect – among other things – countries’ levels of debt today and in the future. If the market’s expectations of fiscal spend and budget surpluses and deficits are not proved correct, this can have a material impact on bonds. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="-/media/8F4B2F59B36440D98D2831DA7CAB2F8F.ashx?h=337&amp;w=600" style="height:337px; width:600px;" alt="Five year projected gross debt across advanced economies" class="custom-image-height-auto" />&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">Recent analysis of IMF data by Bloomberg looked at which countries have headroom to spend and which are less able to open up the fiscal taps<strong>. </strong>The chart shows that Germany, Canada and Sweden are expected to run budget surpluses and reduce their debt:GDP ratios, which should in theory make them more creditworthy and support lower yields for their bonds.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">On the other hand, the US stock of debt is forecast to grow at a faster pace than its economy, reflecting the impact of the giveaway Trump enacted in 2017/2018. As a result of this perceived deterioration in US creditworthiness, treasury yields have already risen from record lows and stand at a big premium to European yields. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">But what if we were to challenge some of these fiscal forecasts? If, for example, Germany, Canada and Sweden were to defy the IMF projections and increase their fiscal spend – perhaps just to the point of balancing their budgets – this could leave their bonds looking vulnerable to capital losses as supply kicks in and yields rise. Equally, were the US fiscal stimulus to spur growth by more than expected, then the IMF’s forecasts could look too pessimistic,&nbsp;possibly putting pressure on bond prices globally.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">Since launch, our strategic funds have largely been long US bonds relative to G7 economies such as Canada and Germany (Sweden does not have a liquid enough futures market to permit a short). We think there is a chance governments will increase fiscal spend to maintain growth, especially now that monetary approaches such as quantitative easing (QE) and zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) seem to have run their course. We have therefore favoured economies – such as the US – where stimulus has already taken place and bond prices have fallen compared with other countries.</span></p>

        <p style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.5pt; text-align: start;"><span style="color: #222222;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

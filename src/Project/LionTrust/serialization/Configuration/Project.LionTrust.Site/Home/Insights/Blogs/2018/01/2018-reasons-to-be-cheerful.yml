        <p><span style="color: #34b233;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Bull markets do not simply die of old age</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #34b233;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"><img height="102" alt="John Husselbee" width="102" src="-/media/54E3A1B23F2F4EF9AABD20B2B5CDD426.ashx"></span></strong></span></p>
        <p><strong>John Husselbee, Head of Multi-Asset:&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Bears are increasingly talking about complacency and markets running out of steam but we continue to believe there could be plenty left in the tank. This comes down to a question of duration versus magnitude: concerns are growing that since we are nine years into a bull market and the economic recovery has taken longer than the typical five or six years, we must be late in the cycle. We would dismiss the idea that bull markets can simply die of old age; it is the magnitude of the growth that is important rather than the length of the run.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">One example from recent history proves this point: the so-called 1990s bull run actually stretched for 12 years, from 1987 to 1999, during which the FTSE 100 rose close to 340%. In the current post-2009 run, the index is up around 90% so no one can claim we are in a situation without precedent, at least when it comes to rising markets.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><img height="382" alt="Bull markets do not simply die of old age" width="600" src="-/media/D439256042F840D1865FF85686C14873.ashx"></span></p>

        Highest European EPS growth in seven years</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong><img height="102" alt="Olly Russ" width="102" src="-/media/00EF2134F4FB44628F30018C047E2AF8.ashx"></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Olly Russ, fund manager, European Income team:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">It looks like 2018 will be the year when the European economic recovery really becomes established. Having lagged the US and UK (in aggregate) for so long, the long-awaited recovery has finally arrived this year, and seems likely to be reinforced in 2018. As this chart shows, 2017 experienced the highest earnings growth rate for seven years as analyst forecasts proved far less susceptible to the serial downgrades which had characterised the previous few years.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The eurozone has faced two huge, almost existential, crises in the last decade: first the Great Financial Crisis, and then the Eurozone Crisis, which was a development of the former, but not suffered by the rest of the world. This has held back economic and earnings progress in Europe for far too long, but finally we should see pent up demand burst through &ndash; capacity utilisation in the eurozone is now at 83.8%, having risen from a low of 69.5% in 2009, and is very close to the 2007 level.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The second element to watch out for is the global effect of the end of quantitative easing (QE). The European Central Bank (ECB) will begin to wind down its QE programme this year, and global QE on a net basis will fall to near zero by autumn. Investors will then find out to what degree financial markets have been sustained by money-printing, and if increased global growth is sufficient to take up the slack.<br>

        Tightening labour market is a sign of economic strength</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong><img height="102" alt="Jamie Clark" width="102" src="-/media/CCC51384FF364ECE8DA6EFF8BF3AAB3C.ashx"></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Jamie Clark, fund manager, Macro-Thematic team:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The chart demonstrates the increasing recruitment difficulties in 2017 for the 700+ UK businesses that take part in the Bank of England survey. Why is this a cause for cheer? The tightening of the labour market is consistent with economists&rsquo; estimates of a UK economy operating at full capacity and bodes well for pay growth. UK unemployment dropped to 4.3% in October 2017 (data which were released in December 2017), the lowest level since the mid-1970s.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Pay growth will soften the present squeeze on real earnings and would also imply that the deflationary pressures of the last decade are ebbing, economic conditions are normalising and interest rates and bond yields will push higher. In such an environment we think that &lsquo;value&rsquo; stocks are likely to benefit, and have positioned portfolios with this in mind. Intuitively, one would expect value stocks to be more sensitive to the economic cycle and empirical evidence shows that value indeed performs well in a world of rising interest rates, inflation expectations and bond yields.<br>

        Attractive Asian Valuations</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong><img height="102" alt="Mark Williams" width="102" src="-/media/DCC82D54CF9F414489689F3FB12757B8.ashx"></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Mark Williams, fund manager, Asia team:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">A global environment of muted inflation with low but stable growth should allow Asian equities to continue to perform well given their attractive valuations. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index trades on a price/earnings ratio of 13.2x based on Bloomberg&rsquo;s consensus analyst estimate, which compares very favourably with other regions: the US is on 18.9x and Europe 14.9x.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Within Asia&rsquo;s attractive average valuation, however, there is substantial variation by country, sector and stock. So while South Korea looks cheap given the progress it is making in reforming its corporate culture, Australia and India appear fully valued. China remains the regional growth engine, despite the gradual slowdown which goes hand-in-hand with its transition to a more sustainable path of development. Although the Chinese economy is decelerating, we believe the investment opportunity is expanding for those who are able to differentiate between the companies that will benefit from the economic transition and those that stand to suffer.<br>

        Global patent trends a reminder that man&rsquo;s ingenuity underpins economic growth</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong><img height="102" alt="Anthony Cross" width="102" src="-/media/990D17AAC67D40B08636D8C42D432913.ashx"></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Anthony Cross, fund manager, Economic Advantage team:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Patents are designed to encourage economic development by allowing the financial benefits of innovation to accrue to the inventor for a specified period before the information enters the public domain. There is a balance to be struck on the length of patent protection &ndash; between incentivising innovation through longer periods and widely disseminating the benefits sooner through shorter patents.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">To the extent that patent applications are a proxy for productivity improvements and future economic growth, the trend is very encouraging. Data from the World Intellectual Property Organisation and RWS Holdings, the world&rsquo;s leading provider of patent translations and intellectual property support services, shows a strong upward trend in patent applications in recent years. This reminds us that secular growth in man&rsquo;s ingenuity cuts through the cyclicality of different economies in the long-run. We expect this trend to be extended when 2017 and 2018 data is released.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Patents are a form of intellectual property, and this is one of the core intangible strengths we look for when investing in companies. We are also investors in RWS Holdings itself. RWS possesses strong Intellectual Property through the know-how of its skilled translators, who often combine both a language and a scientific academic discipline.<br>

        Electric vehicle sales to accelerate</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong><img height="102" alt="Peter Michaelis" width="102" src="-/media/05A599790FD14910A6929D90CDA9ED9F.ashx"></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Peter Michaelis, Head of the Sustainable Investment team:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We look forward to certain key trends becoming more evident in 2018. The take up of electric vehicles, for example, is likely to accelerate as they become cheaper and better performing. The image below shows BMW&rsquo;s sales of electrified vehicles rose 64% year-on-year in the first 11 months of last year, compared with its total sales growth of 3.6%. Solar and wind technologies will also see prices come down, meaning they continue to be the dominant form of new investment for electricity generation.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Innovation in healthcare continues apace and we should start to see the advent of effective gene therapies &ndash; a whole new means of treating and curing debilitating hereditary conditions. As more of our lives (and money) are spent online, so the demand for security services will become even stronger.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">These are some of the themes that underpin the growth of companies in the Sustainable Future portfolios. The macroeconomic outlook for 2018 also looks supportive: some inflation, gradual raising of central bank rates, and a continued modest global economic expansion.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><img height="330" alt="Electric vehicle sales to accelerate" width="600" src="-/media/A18E20F74AA44B589BBF1A676762875D.ashx"></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong><span style="color: #34b233;">Companies with good cash flows look cheap</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong><img height="102" alt="James Inglis-Jones" width="102" src="-/media/7C45FDEAD88E4EE0A03368D61E44ED54.ashx"></strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>James Inglis-Jones, fund manager, Cashflow Solution team:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The prospects for companies with good cash flow generation look healthy. Last year, much of the rise in equity markets was driven by companies that have high forecast growth rates but don&rsquo;t necessarily have robust cash flow. As we highlighted in our <em><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1E135B876FFA49FB9EE6AFDC6D1B4328&amp;_z=z"><span style="color: #34b233;"><em>Reason to be Fearful</em> Halloween chart</span></a></em>, these kind of stocks are now very expensive relative to their historic average.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The counterpoint to this is that companies with strong cash flow characteristics but more mundane growth forecasts are looking cheap by historic standards. &nbsp;Last year was rather mediocre for these cash generative stocks as investors instead focused on the aforementioned stocks with ambitious growth expectations. The outlook for 2018, however, is much stronger. The chart shows that the average company in the top quintile of our quantitative cash flow screens is now trading on a composite valuation which is below its historic (27-year) average.<br>
        <br>

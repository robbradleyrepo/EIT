        <strong>For investment professionals only<br><br>
        The Liontrust GF Special Situations Fund returned 5.1%* in December compared with the 5.0% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong>
        <div><br>
        Global equity markets finished the year strongly, the MSCI World index of developed markets adding 3.5% in December to post a 28.2% gain in 2016. The UK market participated strongly in this rally and the FTSE All-Share finishing at an all-time high of 3,873 points.</div><div><br>
        Cheap money has been a mainstay of developed market monetary policy for a number of years now, providing a tailwind to equity markets and other asset classes. We saw some incremental removal of this stimulus in December, but this did not derail the market’s rally as investors chose to focus on the reflationary economic forces which appear to be coalescing. The US Federal Reserve, as almost universally expected, raised rates by 25bps to 0.75% - a year after it implemented the first hike in this tightening cycle. Its ‘dot plot’ of future rate increases was more aggressive than previous predictions, including three forecast hikes in 2017, up from two in the prior iteration of the report.</div><div><br>
        The European Central Bank clarified its position on its QE programme, which had been scheduled to run at €80bn/month until at least March 2017. It extended the programme until at least December, but also reduced its scale to €60bn. There was some debates as to whether this constituted a ‘taper’ of its programme which could be extrapolated forward or a one-time reduction, but the majority viewed it as a more hawkish move than had been anticipated.</div><div><br>
        December was a reasonably light month for newsflow from portfolio holdings, with no corporate releases from the five negative contributors listed at the bottom of this review. There was more activity within the risers, one of which was RWS Holdings (+20.9%), the patent translation specialist. It released full year results showing that sales increased 28% to £122m and adjusted PBT rose 35%, in-line with the growth rates highlighted in its October trading statement. The profit expansion breaks down to 23% from the acquired CTi business, 2% currency gains and 10% underlying growth. RWS Holdings supplemented these strong financial results for the year to 30 September 2016 with upbeat comments regarding the start of its new year. With the company indicating that performance in the first two months has been very strong and that currency movements have once again been favourable, the shares rallied strongly to new highs in December.</div><div><br>
        Shares in Craneware (+29.3%) bounced back strongly from their US election wobble in November. Craneware provides services to the US healthcare sector, and Trump’s election sparked concerns that the company could be exposed to any attempts to dismantle Obamacare. A November AGM statement highlighted Craneware’s confidence in its growth prospects, and shares in the company have since exaggerated the experience of the wider equity market since the election result – falling initially before rallying strongly on the belief Trump’s administration may take a more measured approach than implied by the tone of his campaign.</div><div><br>
        <p>Plexus Holdings (+15.4%) issued an AGM statement which, as with last year’s equivalent, included a comprehensive assessment of the outlook for the company and the oil &amp; gas industry. Shares in Plexus have been depressed by the recent downturn in energy prices which has had an unavoidable impact on demand for its POS-GRIP® wellhead technology, a fact recognised at length in the statement. But the company also gave reason to be more optimistic on the industry outlook, highlighting the potential for OPEC production cuts and forecasts of demand growth from the International Energy Agency to combine to create a supply crunch. When&nbsp;the market cycle turns up, Plexus is confident of resuming the strong growth trajectory in sales. Until then, it is&nbsp;exploring growth routes which have low capital intensity, such as a pure licensing method for promoting its&nbsp;technology (rather than owning and renting equipment). Plexus believes this has added benefits in accelerating&nbsp;its diversification away from the North Sea, and states that it is currently in discussion with a number of&nbsp;interested parties in the Middle East and India.</p><p>In December we completed the sale of cyber security specialist NCC Group. The company has grown rapidly over&nbsp;the last few years, but recently hit some difficulties in the form of a tough integration process for the acquired&nbsp;Fox-IT business and the loss of some large contracts.</p>
        <p>There were no other changes to portfolio holdings in December. Following completion of the deal between NEX&nbsp;Group (formerly ICAP) and Tullet Prebon, the latter changed its name to TP ICAP.</p>

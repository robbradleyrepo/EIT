        <h6><br></h6><h6>Summary</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>As economies have felt a concerted global acceleration of growth, Asian equities have performed strongly in the first quarter of 2017, rising by more than 11% in sterling terms. The Liontrust Asia Income Fund has lagged, partly due to the performance reversal of some of the strongest performing companies of Q4 2016, partly due to low exposures to India and South Korea.</li>
            <li>We have added a holding in India to the portfolio but otherwise there has been little change to the weightings in the portfolio.</li>
            <li>Looking forward, while acknowledging the escalated political risks, especially surrounding North Korea, our base case remains positive for Asia Pacific equities, with earnings growth of almost 10% and valuations marginally below their historical averages.</li>

        <p><br></p><p>Source: Financial Express, as at 31.03.17, total return, bid-to-bid. Fund launched on 05.03.12.</p>
        <p>A significant element of the Fund’s relative performance was swift reversal of the companies that had displayed the most strength in the last quarter of 2016. In the list of worst performing equities in the recent quarter, Anta Sports, RHT Health Trust, China Communications Services, Texwinca and Duet all feature in the top movers of the Fund’s holdings in Q4 2016. An additional two that the Fund did not own – Tencent Holdings and Alibaba – were significant positives compared to an index at the end of 2016 but have been detrimental this year as they have rebounded.</p>
        <p>Aside from the swift market reversals, there has been some more significant change. At a country level the two strongest performers have been India (+15.2% in sterling) and Korea (+13.7%). South Korea in particular is a country that the Fund has little exposure to, which has hurt overall performance. We marginally increased the Fund’s exposure to India during the quarter, but the negative impact from Singapore-listed RHT Health Trust hurt the overall return from the country this quarter.</p>
        <p>In India, Modi’s landslide win in Uttar Pradesh for the BJP has been one of Asia’s major events so far this year. Coming after last year’s removal of 85% of currency notes from circulation, it is a strong mark of approval for the Modi government. We continue to struggle with the country’s equity valuations, however, which seem to more than factor in the admittedly positive economic, political and demographic backdrop. We continue to believe that we are likely to achieve more attractive entry points at another time, and can find more compelling alternatives in other parts of the region. In the meantime India remains the second most expensive market in our universe at 17.6x forward earnings, beaten only by the Philippines.</p>
        <p>South Korea has its own independent narrative which is potentially more interesting at the moment. The country’s two big events of the quarter – although seemingly unconnected – both potentially play into the same picture of improvements. The first is the court decision that Hanjin Shipping, in administration since the last day of August 2016, was worth more in liquidation than as an ongoing entity. Allowing companies to fail has not traditionally been South Korea’s default policy, instead often finding a strange marriage of convenience to keep entities alive. The second is that Samsung Electronics vice chairman, and son of the group’s founder, was arrested as part of an ongoing investigation. This will have little corporate impact, but it is a clear sign of a change of heart for the current administration. South Korea’s model for development has historically been government encouraged, financially supported dominance of the ‘chaebols’ – large, often family-controlled, conglomerates. That the vested interests in these seem to be losing their immunity opens the door to significantly improved returns from Korean companies, and could even see a reduction over time in their valuation discount.</p>
        <p>We have had a very little South Korean exposure since the Fund’s launch, which has benefitted performance, but we will be keeping a close eye on developments as elections loom. If a left leaning government takes power and continues to tackle the chaebol structures this could have a significant benefit for dividend payments as well as the more general returns of the market.</p>
        <p>For the rest of the region the biggest change was an improvement in overall growth. As has been the case in the US, signs of ongoing reflation and economic improvement have continued to surprise. As a good guide, the majority of purchasing managers indices have been in positive territory, indicating an expansionary stage of the economic cycle, while earnings have tended to beat expectations. This in turn is leading to a move by governments from accommodative monetary positions towards more neutral ones. The region’s strongest growth comes from China and Taiwan, two of our favoured investment areas, while Australia is one of the weaker areas.</p>
        <p>We believe the improving economic backdrop is a positive development. This is also true in the US, even while it has led the Federal Reserve to raise rates. While many seem concerned that rising US interest rates and a potentially strong US dollar will be bad for emerging markets, we do not agree. For the US to be in a position to raise rates as a result of a recovering economy, no longer solely underpinned by QE, should be a positive for the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>In this environment there was little change to the portfolio. We initiated a position in Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IHFL), which is the 4th largest housing finance company in India. It has conservative exposure with low risk mortgages accounting for 55% of the loan book with average loans in the range of US$35,000-40,000 and loan-to-value ratios of less than 70%. The balance sheet and asset quality are strong with non-performing loans less than 1% of the total. The company trades at a forward price to book of 2.5x with return on equity in excess of 25%, loan growth in excess of 20% and a dividend yield of 4.2%. </p>
        <p>We funded the new position from inflows and by reducing our stake in HCL Technologies. There have been a number of bills introduced in US Congress aimed at making it more difficult or costly for Indian IT companies to send their employees to the US on H1B visas. There is also a risk of a change in the visa allocation process from a lottery based system to one based on those paying the highest salaries. The US accounts for approximately 60% of revenues for most of the Indian IT companies and any significant change to the H1B visa process will be a negative. Given the increased risk, we decided to pare down our exposure.</p>
        Looking forward, while growth has accelerated and there has been diminished concern about the economic health of the region (Chinese foreign exchange reserves have stabilised and there is far less chatter about the imminent demise of the Chinese financial system), political risks have escalated. While a global trade war is still not our base case, the risk of a North Korea policy misstep is rising. Although it has to remain an unlikely outcome, as military engagement would surely result in the demise of North Korea, risks abound as the two key protagonists – Trump and Kim Jong-Un – are both politically inexperienced. The unpredictability of the situation makes it hard to alter our exposure with this in mind, but it is obviously something that we continue to monitor closely.<br>

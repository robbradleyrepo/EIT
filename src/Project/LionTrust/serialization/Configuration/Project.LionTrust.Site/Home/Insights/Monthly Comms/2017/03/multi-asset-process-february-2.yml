        <strong>For investment professionals only<br>
        </strong><br>
        Trumpflation continued to work its spell during February, with equity markets hitting new highs and even the MSCI World Index joining the party with an all-time peak mid-month.<br>
        <br>
        Bond yields also dropped again after rising for a period, which suggests fixed income shares the same enthusiasm for the reflation trade.<br>
        <br>
        Talk of market records is becoming commonplace and the Dow enjoyed 12 days of consecutive highs in the second half of the month, matching a similar spell in 1987.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Market watchers might cast a cautious eye at that date and note that just a few months afterwards, the Black Monday crash caused global turmoil. The higher markets climb, the more vulnerable they become but while I would expect pullbacks over the coming months, barring any massive unexpected shocks, there are no signs we might see more than the usual ebb and flow.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Apart from the Trump trade and growing optimism about global growth, inflation expectations have also played a part in booming markets. Prices are rising in the UK, US and Europe – US CPI hit a four-year high in February – and this is likely to lead to higher interest rates, with a US rate hike possible in March.<br>
        <br>
        We have seen a sea change in policy since the start of 2016, acknowledging the long road of austerity and printing money has come to an end and a new approach is needed to stimulate growth. Overall, it is fair to say austerity has led to a lack of confidence, among businesses and consumers, and there is now a fresh impetus on governments to lead by example and begin spending again.<br>
        <br>
        We are moving from an era of belt tightening to loosening: from lower to higher growth, inflation and bond yields and Trump is the encapsulation of this reflationary ideal.<br>
        <br>
        Of course, the month also featured what are becoming the customary macro scares and political controversy, with the latest North Korean missile test, a further deterioration in US-China relations and ongoing regional conflicts in the Middle East.<br>
        <br>
        In the UK, we had by-elections during the month and more problems for the Labour Party, although Brexit continues to overshadow any other political activity. Despite ongoing talk of some kind of resistance – championed by Tony Blair among others – it seems the government has started down a hard Brexit path and that obviously leaves open significant economic uncertainties.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Not all of these would necessarily be negative for the economy but ongoing debate about Brexit and its implementation is likely to be a huge factor in sentiment until we get more certainty. The starting point will be the triggering of Article 50, with the government’s March deadline fast approaching.<br>
        <br>
        With inflation and growth rising and even the housing market looking solid, we would be expecting the Bank Of England to mirror the Federal Reserve’s rate hiking policy in the coming months if not for Brexit; with so much uncertainty however, it is frankly anyone’s guess when we might see a rise in the UK.<br>
        <br>
        As we have said before, the recent rise of populism perhaps spells the beginning of the end of globalisation and in the current environment, making any kind of predictions is fraught with danger. But while macro twists and turns cause havoc for short-term speculators, these events create opportunity for long-term patient investors.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Trump made many pledges during his election campaign and has begun the long process of enacting some of these. His main policy is to seek a return of manufacturing to the US through fiscal, trade and immigration and ultimately, the success of this will be dictated by the co-operation of Congress and the law courts. With that in mind, much of his rhetoric will likely be watered down before being passed into law.<br>
        <br>
        US markets are currently staying afloat on improving fundamentals, feeding through to earnings, and more importantly, a belief that corporate tax will come down from the current 39%. While few are expecting Trump’s 15% figure – a watered down 25% is seen as more likely – any improvement would help future earnings and if the cut fails to materialise, that is a major rug pulled out from under the market.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Markets have quickly decided that whatever happens, Trump is good for the domestic economy and bad for exporters into the US. In financial markets, US smaller companies rose sharply post-election while Asia Pacific ex-Japan and emerging markets were shunned. This trade, at face value, seemed somewhat at odds with long-term fundamentals and Asia/emerging markets have already seen a bounce back so far this year.

        <p class="Default"><strong><span>Sold &ndash; Challenger. </span></strong><span>Shares in the company had recovered by around 50% from their March lows. While the long-term outlook for the annuities business in Australia still looks robust, the near term is likely to be negatively impacted by interest rates remaining lower for longer. Challenger has also de-risked its investment portfolio to guard against market volatility, which will affect earnings growth next year.</span></p>

        <p style="color: #222222; background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.5pt;"><span>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Asia team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The Fund&rsquo;s expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.&nbsp;</span></p>

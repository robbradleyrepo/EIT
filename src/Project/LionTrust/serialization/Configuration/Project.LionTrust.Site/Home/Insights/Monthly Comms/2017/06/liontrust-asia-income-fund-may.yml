        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: left;">Bought</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: left;"> </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: left;">– KB Financial. </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: left;">We expect shares in the company to re-rate to reflect an improvement in fundamentals. Net interest margins are set to increase in 2017 and non-interest income will be bolstered by the full acquisition of Hyundai Securities, which should deliver higher contributions as its operations scale up over the next two years.&nbsp;In addition, KB Financial intends to acquire all outstanding shares in KB Insurance and KB Capital which will further boost the contribution from non-interest income.&nbsp;</span>There is also scope for further profitability improvements through a reduction in the proportion of costs necessary to generate income from 50.6% as of 1Q17 to a mid-40% range. Asset quality remains sound with less than 1% of loans non-performing and the company’s common equity tier 1 ratio of 14.9% is the highest in the industry. The shares look attractively valued on a FY2017 price-to-book of c.0.7x with a 9% return on equity and a 2.3% dividend yield.</li>
            <li><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Bought</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">–</strong><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> </strong><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">IRB InvIT. </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">This is</span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">the first Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) to be listed in India. It includes six road projects with an average residual life of 12 years with toll rates increasing in line with inflation. The InvIT is expected to provide a 12% dividend yield with revenues expected to grow by 10%. We have valued the trust based on a DCF valuation using a discount rate of 350bps above 10 year government bond yields – a similar premium to Singapore REITs. This yields a target price which suggests 16% upside from current levels.</span></li>
            <li><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Sold – Duet. </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Shares in the Australian owner of energy utility assets exited the portfolio following completion of a takeover by a consortium of Hong Kong-based infrastructure investors. The agreed price of A$3 a share represents a healthy premium to the prior market price as well as the amount paid when adding the position to the Fund in late 2013.</span></li>

        <p><strong>The Fund returned -0.9%* in sterling terms in September, compared with the -0.8% return from the MSCI Europe ex-UK index.</strong></p>
        <p>An appreciation of the pound caused returns in sterling terms to be negative this month; the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index returning 4.1% in local currency terms. The pound climbed after the Bank of England&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee stated that &ldquo;some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months&rdquo; if the UK economy continues on its current path. This came as a surprise to the market, causing it to reprice the chance of a UK interest rate increase in the MPC&rsquo;s next meeting in November. The hawkish tone was echoed in the US, where the Federal Open Market Committee indicated one more interest rate increase in 2017 and three more in 2018. Bond yields in both the UK and US rose, with UK 10-year yields reaching their highest level since February and US 10-year reaching two month highs. Broadly speaking, defensive sectors of the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index lagged &ndash; utilities (-4.9%), real estate (-4.5%) and consumer staples (-4.1%) &ndash; while more cyclical areas were in demand &ndash; materials (+2.1%), consumer discretionary (+1.2%) and industrials (+1.1%).</p>
        <p>The Fund&rsquo;s three largest positive contributors this month were all driven by a rise in the oil price. Brent oil climbed 10% to reach its highest level in just over two years at US$59.02 a barrel. Oil refineries across the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean were shut as the storms hit the region. Crude prices were further supported after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to turn off an Iraqi oil pipeline following the Kurdish independence referendum vote. Swedish oil producer <strong>Tethys Oil </strong>(+9.3%), Norwegian offshore drilling contractor <strong>Fred Olsen Energy </strong>(+40.7%) and Norwegian offshore engineering and support services group <strong>Subsea 7</strong> (+9.9%) all rallied.</p>
        <p><strong>Liberbank </strong>(-26.8%) weighed most heavily on Fund performance in September. The distressed Spanish lender proposed a &euro;500m capital increase to bolster its financial reserves as it aims to continue reducing its bad loan ratio. Its share price partially recovered after regulators banned short-selling of the stock through to the end of November 2017. The stock is held in the Fund for its contrarian value appeal, which is often characterised by the presence of tough trading conditions, sceptical investors and management restructuring efforts. This investor scepticism is currently leading the shares to be very susceptible to sentiment towards financials in the eurozone periphery &ndash; which has taken a hit recently following the collapse of peer Banco Popular.</p>
        <p>Other holdings to end the month in negative territory included <strong>Lenzing </strong>(-11.4%), which dropped on concerns about the impact of price weakness in its Viscose brand, and <strong>Oriflame </strong>(-10.1%), during a month in which consumer staples companies were out of favour. Overall, however, the Fund&rsquo;s low exposure to consumer staples relative to the market was a source of positive attribution. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Fred Olsen Energy (+40.7%), Subsea 7 (+9.9%) and Tethys Oil (+9.3%).<strong></strong></p>

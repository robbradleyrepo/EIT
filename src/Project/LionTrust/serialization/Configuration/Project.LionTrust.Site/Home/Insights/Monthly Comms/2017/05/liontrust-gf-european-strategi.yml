        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund returned 1.4%* in euro terms in April, compared with the 1.7% return from the MSCI Europe Index and the 0.6% return of the HFRX Equity Hedge EUR Index.</strong></p>
        <p>Net exposure at month end was c.59%. The Fund’s long book contribution significantly outperformed the rise in the MSCI Europe index and offset some weakness in the short-book.</p>
        <p>After months of anticipation, European equities and the euro received a shot in the arm from the first round of the French presidential election. Centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen ended as the two front runners ahead of the second round of voting in May. Markets had been concerned about growing support for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon and the prospect of a far-left versus far-right battle. However, Macron’s victory in the first round has provided a clear favourite. The euro appreciated by 1.4% in trade-weighted terms between the result’s announcement and the end of the month.</p>
        <p>The financials sector was among those to react positively to the result (+2.3%), boosted by the perception of a more certain path for the French economy and eurozone under Macron. A ‘risk-on’ reaction saw other cyclical sectors performer strongly, including industrials (+3.9%) and consumer discretionary (+3.4%).</p>
        <p>In the UK, Prime Minister May called for a surprise snap election to be held on 8 June. Opinion polls give her a considerable lead over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. ‘Trumpflation’ continued to support US stock indices, with the S&amp;P 500 close to an all-time high during the month. However, investors were underwhelmed by the president’s proposal to cut corporate tax to 15% from 35% due to the lack of detail, particularly around the funding of the cut. </p>
        <p>Within the Fund’s long book contributors list, Swiss dentistry company Straumann Holding (+12.5%) announced strong first quarter results. Group revenue was up 20% year-on-year and it achieved double-digit organic growth across all divisions. The group also raised full-year guidance for organic growth to a low-double digit percentage range from a high single-digit range it had previously predicted in its full-year results. </p>
        <p>Partners Group (+10.3%) was among those to react particularly well to Macron’s victory. The Swiss investment manager also announced that it acquired UK-based Key Retirement Group in a deal which valued the latter at over £200 million. Investors welcomed JD Sports Fashion Group’s (+17.0%) full-year results, in which the company posted a record adjusted pre-tax profit of £245m. The sports fashion division generated an adjusted operating profit increase of 50%, while the outdoor business delivered its first ever operating profit. </p>
        <p>The materials sector (-0.2%) lagged the market in April as iron ore prices hit a five month low, and sector holdings were a slight area of weakness within the Fund’s long-book performance. Among the Fund’s holdings, BHP Billiton (-3.5%) and Rio Tinto (-3.3%) issued updates. BHP lowered its full-year guidance for copper production due to the effect of industrial action at its Escondida copper mine and cut its full-year expectation for coal production as a result of damage caused by Cyclone Debbie. Peer Rio Tinto maintained production guidance despite challenging weather conditions at its West Australian and Queensland operations. </p>
        <p>In the Fund’s short book, there was a positive contribution from a UK company that funds early stage start-ups in the life sciences and technology sectors. In recent months, the shares have come under pressure due to disappointing trading updates and management change and uncertainty. Early in April, the company announced some restructuring measures including the discontinuation of funding for a number of subsidiaries. Management commented this will potentially include the markdown of the entire value of these subsidiaries.</p>
        <p>A further short book highlight was the Fund’s exposure to a French electronic transaction services company whose shares declined following a profit warning from a US peer citing pricing and volume pressure.</p>
        <p>A US beverages producer was a detractor from short book performance after its shares rose in response to takeover speculation. &nbsp;Another short book detractor from performance was a German based equipment manufacturer for the semi-conductor industry. The shares rallied following the publication of Q1 results, which included a higher-than-expected order intake.</p><p><br></p>

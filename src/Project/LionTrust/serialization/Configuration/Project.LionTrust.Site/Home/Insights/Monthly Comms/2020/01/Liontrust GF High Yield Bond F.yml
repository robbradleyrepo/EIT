        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Fund (C5 accumulation class) returned 2.2%* in sterling terms in Q4 2019 versus 2.5% from the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global High Yield Index (GBP hedged) and a 1.7% average from the IA Sterling High Yield sector. The primary B5 US dollar share class returned 2.6% versus 2.9% from the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global High Yield Index (USD hedged).</span></strong><span><strong><span> </span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>Global High Yield Market</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span><br />After an already good year, the market was given the December gift of greater clarity on the progress of ‘phase one’ of the China/US trade deal. This happened alongside mildly improving global economic data and, to the extent it impacts global markets, a Conservative majority in the UK election. This meant, like risk assets in general, high yield ended the year in an entirely different manner to that of 2018. The 2.9% Q4 US dollar return (2.5% in sterling and 2.2% in euros) took the global high yield market return for 2019 to 14.5% (12.3% sterling, 11.1% euros). This was the fourth best return for the global market in the decade.</span></p>
        <p><span>Until December, the theme of the year had been the persistent outperformance of higher quality and the continued under-performance of the energy sector. In December, this was flipped on its head with, for example, both US energy and global CCC sub-indices producing US dollar returns in excess of 5% in December. Clearly cyclicals and lower quality had been suffering as a result of the trade uncertainty. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>The Fund</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span><br />Although marginally behind the ICE index in Q4, the Fund’s C5 accumulation class returned 13.9% in sterling terms over the year, ahead of the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global High Yield Index (GBP hedged) return of 12.3% (B5 US dollar return of 15.9% compares with 14.5% from the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global High Yield Index, USD hedged). </span></p>
        <p><span>We believe a good active manager should be able to materially outperform a global high yield ETF over the long term after fees. We are happy to report that the sterling share class modestly outperformed a leading global high yield ETF in Q4, taking the Fund’s 2019 outperformance of the ETF to around 2.7%</span></p>
        <p><span>As we wrote in the last report, in the autumn we were ‘dipping our toes’ in lower-quality credit, though on a relative basis we remained significantly light of low quality and what we describe as thematically cyclical risk, e.g. US energy/commodity cyclicals in general. Our sector positioning was a drag on relative performance in the aforementioned year-end rally. For example, the light energy sector exposure ‘cost’ the Fund ~35bps of relative performance in Q4. </span></p>
        <p><span>Of course, the ‘correct’ short term exposure would have been to have our ankles wet! Yet, at this point in the cycle, we are not looking to scrape every last morsel of return out of the market by buying weaker parts of the credit market. If that means a period of relative underperformance whilst there is an indiscriminate rally, then so be it. The asymmetric risk profile in fixed income means opportunity cost tends to be low, whereas default cost can be very high. Worry about what you hold for your clients, not what you don’t!</span></p>
        <p><span>Our Fund-level activity in Q4 was fairly limited when compared to previous quarters. The main theme in our trading has been to rotate into newer issues from some of our existing holdings</span><span>. For example, we own a new issue from Biofuel producer, <strong>Enviva</strong>, which replaces the bond they have now called. We switched from an expensive Level 3 (US telecom <strong>CenturyLink</strong>) 2025 bond into a newly issued 2026. Likewise, we switched from a consumer autos finance company, <strong>Credit Acceptance</strong> 2023 into a newly issued 2024 bond. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Outlook</span></strong></p>
        <p><span><br />At a starting point of ~5% yield in US dollar terms (~4% GBP), the global high yield market is less exciting to us than it was last year when it started at 7.5% in US dollar terms. However, with defaults likely to remain fairly moderate and yields remaining low across most liquid assets (which we consider high yield to be), there is no obvious reason to shun high yield in 2020 - particularly given the resilience it persistently shows when compared to equities over the longer term. </span></p>
        <p><span>The Liontrust Global Fixed Income team has been fairly sanguine on the developed market economic outlook since we launched funds and we have not materially changed our views. Global high yield valuations are, we believe, largely reflective of decent growth expectations alongside the view that the Fed and European Central Bank are unlikely to tighten monetary policy any time soon. Obviously, any weaker than expected economic conditions can play a significant role in determining returns. The oddity of the last decade has been that sometimes ‘bad news’ is good for returns due to the perceived central bank put; and good news can be the opposite (see, for example, Q418) if the market thinks accommodation is being taken away. What the next decade has in store for us, we will have to wait and see. We continue to favour making good lending decisions, investing in decent businesses. </span></p>
        <p><span>Happy New Year and, as we say in Scotland, lang may yer lums reek!</span></p>

        <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #222222;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

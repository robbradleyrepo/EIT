        <p><strong>The Liontrust Special Situations Fund returned -1.1%* in November, compared with the -1.7% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The focus early in the month was on the Bank of England’s historic rate rise, its first for over a decade. The move was well flagged, but the market reaction after the decision suggested that investors do not expect any further tightening in policy in the near future. Sterling slipped following the announcement but during the rest of the month it more than regained the lost value.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">General UK equity weakness this month was largely derived from underwhelming earnings reports, with large-cap stocks underperforming (FTSE 100 returning -1.8% compared to the FTSE 250’s -1.2% and the FTSE Small Cap’s -0.8%).</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Within the Fund, the biggest large cap detractor was </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Compass Group </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(-9.3%) which fell despite releasing strong full-year numbers. The catering company reported a 15% increase in headline revenue and an 18% improvement in operating profits. Both revenue and profit were boosted by an 11% translational benefit from weaker sterling. Management provided another positive outlook, citing an encouraging pipeline of new contracts and expected progress on efficiencies. However, growth is expected to be second half weighted which slightly disappointed the market.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Financial intermediary companies </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">TP ICAP </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(-7.1%) and </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">NEX Group </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(-6.5%) were both among the weakest performers following updates. TP ICAP noted a 3% year-on-year increase in pro forma revenue in the third quarter of 2017 despite mixed market conditions. However, the group stated that the outlook for the fourth quarter remains challenging and that its chief financial officer was stepping down. NEX Group released interim results for the six months to end September. The company reported a fall in pre-tax profit to £48m from £66m last year, impacted by an £11m hit from one-off items and increases in underlying effective tax rate. The company also rebased its dividend payment to 3.5p from 11.5p.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Despite the decline this month, there were positive stories to note. </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Bango </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(+13.1%) announced two new deals, boosting its share price. The mobile payments company expanded its direct carrier billing services to Amazon Prime customers in Japan. It also launched operator-billed payments for Google Play users with 9mobile in Nigeria.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Kainos Group’s</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> (+10.8%) share price rose following the release of interim results. The IT services and consulting company recorded a 2% annual increase in revenue and 5% improvement in pre-tax profit, which Kainos stated was in line with market expectations. The group lifted its dividend payment by 5% and indicated that it remains well placed to deliver growth in the coming years.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Temporary power supplier </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Aggreko</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> (-9.3%) reported higher revenue for the third quarter of 2017, but its Power Solutions Utility business saw a 15% decrease in revenue due to repricing and off-hires in Argentina. The company, nonetheless, maintained its guidance for the full-year.</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Software-as-a-service provider </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">dotdigital Group</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> (+5.6%) acquired the Comapi group of companies for £11m. Comapi is focused on the omni-channel messaging and cloud communication market and reported revenue of £7.8m in 2016. Management stated the addition will extend dotdigital’s marketing automation platform and also expands the group’s services beyond the UK.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"> <span>• Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</span></p>

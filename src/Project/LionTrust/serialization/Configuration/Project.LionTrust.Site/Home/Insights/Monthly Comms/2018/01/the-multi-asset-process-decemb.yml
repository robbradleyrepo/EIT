        <p><span>Anyone hoping for some Brexit respite in the final weeks of the year would have been sorely disappointed as the subject dominated the news once again in December.</span></p>
        <p><span>Days of talks between UK and European negotiators eventually ended in what Theresa May called a hard won agreement to move things to the next stage although months of debate on citizen&rsquo;s rights, the cost of the divorce bill and issues such as borders with Ireland are still to come.</span></p>
        <p><span>As ever with Brexit, the Prime Minister&rsquo;s so-called victory was followed shortly by disaster, with </span><span>Conservative rebels in the Commons defeating the Government in a key vote.</span><span> </span><span>MPs backed an amendment giving them a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels &ndash; which can only muddy what are already filthy waters.</span></p>
        <p><span>Another prevalent trend through 2017 has been a series of fresh highs for equity markets and once again, December did not disappoint. On the last working day of the year, the FTSE 100 again hit an all-time high of 7687 and indices such as the S&amp;P 500 also registered new records during the month.</span></p>
        <p><span>Overall, the blue-chip UK index gained close to 8% over the year, while Japan&rsquo;s Topix and the S&amp;P 500 were both up around 20%. </span><span>Global stocks, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index, rose in every single month of 2017, the first time shares have avoided any monthly declines within a calendar year.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>December proved busy on the macro front, with the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s third interest rate hike of 2017. Widely expected in the market, the Bank said this hike </span><span>underscores solid gains in the US economy and also boosted its economic forecasts for 2018, allowing outgoing chair Janet Yellen to paint a positive picture of her tenure. </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 13.5pt 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span>"There's less to lose sleep about now than has been true for quite some time, so I feel good about the economic outlook," she said.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 13.5pt 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span>The Fed anticipates three further increases in rates next year, unchanged from its previous forecast.</span><span> </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 13.5pt 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span>President Trump also managed to pass the biggest tax overhaul in three decades during the month and, while there remains plenty of controversy surrounding these measures, the benefits for corporations and individuals are expected to boost many sectors of the economy in 2018.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 13.5pt 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Elsewhere, November&rsquo;s inflation reading of 3.1% required Bank of England governor Mark Carney to write a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond (to explain why it has strayed more than 1% away from the 2% target).</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span><br>
        While <span class="mfirst-letter">t</span>hat uptick in inflation may look alarming, the overwhelming consensus of economists&nbsp;believe rising prices should now have hit their peak and will not concern the Monetary Policy Committee. The largest upward contribution came from airfares, which fell by less than in 2016, and core inflation actually held steady around 2.7%.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>Looking into 2018, equities remain more attractive than bonds and cash but we need to be wary of complacency after such a strong year for stock markets.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>While no one is ever keen for a downturn, we have long been surprised not to see the kind of 5% to 10% correction that has traditionally been a function of healthy markets and as we have long said, would not be overly concerned if such a recalibration does materialise. </span></p>
        <p><span>We continue to look to buy favoured areas when they are cheap and are currently eyeing an opportunity in value stocks, where performance remains far removed from surging growth companies. We felt this could be a theme for 2017 but value has remained depressed and we believe now may be a good time to increase exposure to this cheaper end of the market via funds such as Fidelity Special Situations. </span></p>
        <span>We see this as a broad trend, most obvious in the US, but also prevalent across Europe, Japan and Emerging Markets.</span>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust Strategic Bond Fund returned 0.4%* in sterling terms in December, compared with the 0.5% average return from the IA Sterling Strategic Bond sector. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>Market backdrop<br /><br /></span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Economic data improved in December with many signs that global industrial production has found a base.&nbsp; Furthermore, the mood music surrounding trade talks between the US and China has been soothing, with a ‘phase one’ trade deal due to be signed on January 15<sup>th</sup>. Government bond yields rose and credit spreads tightened, just as one would anticipate in such an environment.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The small retracement in government bond yields in December is but a blip in what proved to be a very strong year for all the major fixed income asset classes. Over the course of 2019, US 10-year yields compressed by 120 basis points to a low of 1.45% in September before then giving up over a third of the gains to finish the year at 1.90%.&nbsp; German 10-year Bunds spent most of 2019 in negative yielding territory, bottoming a little below -0.70% before finishing at -0.20%. Overall there was a 35 basis point compression between the US and German bond markets. The Fund has had a long-held strategy of preferring the former over the latter and thus this aided performance.&nbsp; Additionally, we have taken positioning in the 5 and 10-year tenors within the US, most of the time eschewing the 30-year (i.e. we have had a curve steepener on); these were the stronger parts of the market. Sovereign bond valuations continue to be absurd and we retain a low beta approach to duration risk. Focusing on where to take the limited interest rate risk we have in the Fund has proved to be just as important as the amount of risk itself.</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We would be very surprised if 2020 proves to be a year where you are rewarded for blindly owning bond beta.&nbsp; The over-riding message from most of the developed market central banks is that they have done as much policy loosening as they intend to. We still posit that many central banks have overdone the loosening; we are past the “reversal rate” and monetary policy is counterproductive for growth, but that is a subject for another time.&nbsp; One of the key themes for 2020 will be the increased emphasis on the fiscal side of the policy equation to do the heavy lifting at boosting growth. An increased fiscal deficit is almost inevitable in the UK, Japan and most of the eurozone; even Germany is likely to reduce its budget surplus. In the US, fiscal loosening had already occurred with a deficit of approximately 4.5% of GDP. From that level it is difficult to envisage much more government largesse, but in an election year nothing can be ruled out entirely.</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Overall, we are pretty much in line with the market consensus in saying that world economic growth will be stronger this year and trade tensions will dissipate but not disappear. Where we differ from consensus is on the inflation front. Many labour markets are tight and the negative price impulse from the industrial production growth collapse is fading whilst services inflation remains remarkably sticky. Global inflation is likely to be above 2% in 2020, not necessarily worrisome but completely at odds with the yields on quality sovereign debt, creating a recipe for further financial repression. Unless you make some very bold assumptions about capital upside then 10-year government bonds will almost certainly lose you real money over the next decade and are highly likely to lose nominal money too in most jurisdictions.</span><br /></p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Rates</strong><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Compared to our neutral rates position of 4.5 years we continue to run with a much lower beta and until valuations significantly improve expect this to remain the case. As 2019 drew to a close, yields rose on low volumes so we took the opportunity to tactically increase duration</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><sup>†</sup></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> to a little above 3 years. By the second working day of January profits were taken and the Fund was back at 3 years of duration exposure.</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Within the Fund’s rates exposure, we continue to strategically prefer the US market and believe further compression versus Europe is likely in 2020. The curve positioning is more evenly spread now. We see an 80 basis point differential between 5 and 30-year US debt as a good potential entry point for a curve flattener. We retain 0.50-0.75 years of exposure to TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) where breakeven rates offer good inflation protection at ~170bps on the 5-year and 180bps on the 10-year.</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Our focus on alpha generation continues to reap small, but incrementally cumulative, rewards. We took profits on half of the Switzerland versus Germany position leaving the Fund with a 0.25-year cross market position. A short Australia versus long New Zealand position also made a positive contribution; the former was closed out leaving 0.25 years in New Zealand.</span><br /></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Allocation</strong><br /></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>The Fund ended 2018 and started 2019 aggressively adding to cheap credit, a move which was rapidly vindicated as spreads significantly tightened. For most of 2019 we were then more conservatively positioned once the extreme valuation case had unwound.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Trading activity was quite light in the less liquid December markets. The main aim was to maintain aggregate asset class weightings as we invested strong positive cash flows into the Fund. Thus, the Fund finished the year with approximately 45% in investment grade credit with just under 40% in conventional bonds and the balance in floating rates notes. The high yield weighting is 15% with a little over 10% in physical bonds and the balance a CDS index overlay. To repeat our mantra, when valuations improve we will buy more credit.</span><br /></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Selection</strong><br /></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>December was another month of generating incremental returns from stock selection. <strong>AbbVie</strong>, which we discussed in November’s report, saw its secondary market bonds rally strongly post the new issue. Other names generating a handful of basis points of excess performance in the month included <strong>British American Tobacco</strong>, an <strong>RBS</strong> special situation legacy capital bond and <strong>Eli Lilly</strong> in euros.<br /></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br /></p>

        <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #222222;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

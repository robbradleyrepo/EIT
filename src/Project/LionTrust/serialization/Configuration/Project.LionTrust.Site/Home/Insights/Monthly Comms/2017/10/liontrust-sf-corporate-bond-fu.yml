        <p><strong>Following a strong first half of 2017, the Fund outperformed its benchmark again in Q3, registering returns of 0.43% against 0.19 from the iBoxx Sterling Corporate Index *.</strong></p>
        <p>Drivers of this performance were similar to trends from the first half, namely stock selection within the bank, insurance and retail sectors, overall positive attribution from our sector positioning &ndash; particularly the overweight in insurance &ndash; and our underweight duration position.</p>
        <p>We still prefer banks and insurers as both areas offer attractive valuations and the prospect that higher interest rates should boost operating margins over time.</p>
        <p>Over Q3, we developed several of these calls, increasing the duration short for example as the interest rates market rallied. </p>
        <p>We also reduced the short position on US interest rates due to political concerns &ndash; primarily sabre rattling of the nuclear variety from President Trump and his Korean counterpart &ndash; and will look to increase this again as tensions ease and the focus returns to improving economic growth. Elsewhere, we continued to move up the capital structure within subordinated banks and insurance names.</p>
        <p>Looking towards Q4 and beyond, we remain bearish on interest rates as central bank policy increasingly moves to a tightening bias. </p>
        <p>September finally gave us some certainty on this front, at least as far as the US Federal Reserve is concerned, as the Bank announced the first stage of its great unwinding plans. The Fed will start cutting its $4.5 trillion balance sheet in October, initially by $10bn per month and chair&nbsp;Janet Yellen&nbsp;said the normalisation process would be gradual and predictable.</p>
        <p>Although we expect yields to remain low in a historic context, we believe government yields will continue to normalise over the coming twelve months and negative real rates on nominal government bonds in the UK are unsustainable.</p>
        <p>We remain positive on corporate bonds, supported by strong fundamentals including strong PMIs in the UK, Europe and the US, a thriving consumer and robust housing market in America and continued growth in Emerging Markets. In addition, the supply and demand backdrop is also positive for the asset class.</p>

There is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund&rsquo;s share price.</p>

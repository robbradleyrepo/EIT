        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust Special Situations Fund returned 1.5%* in September, compared with the -0.4% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></p>
        <p>The portfolio&rsquo;s return profile this month was more a result of prevailing trends in investor sentiment rather than a reflection of fundamental company developments. Much of the price action appeared to stem from hawkish monetary policy comments on both sides of the Atlantic. With both the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve signalling rate hikes in the remainder of this year, investors moved to price in the implication of a positive economic growth assessment while also moving away from those stocks with more defensive appeal.</p>
        <p>Some of the Fund&rsquo;s consumer goods stocks were caught up in the de-rating of defensive sectors but, when compared with the FTSE All-Share Index, the Fund&rsquo;s lack of telecoms and utilities protected it from some of the weakest spots in the market. Positive attribution also stemmed from the Fund&rsquo;s commodities exposure &ndash; benefitting from a rally in the oil price via its integrated oil and support services holdings &ndash; but avoiding the 5.6% drop in the basic materials sector.</p>
        <p>Supply side factors drove the Brent crude spot price 10% higher to $57.5/barrel as category 5 hurricanes Irma and Maria followed Harvey in disrupting oil production. Other industrial commodities such as iron ore (-19%) and copper (-4.6%) were softer, as Chinese growth expectations moderated. So while <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> (+6.2%) and <strong>BP</strong> (+7.2%) were the FTSE&rsquo;s top cap-weighted contributors, Rio Tinto (-7.3%) and BHP Billiton (-9.0%) &ndash; neither of which are held in the Fund &ndash; were among the biggest detractors.</p>
        <p>The oil price rally fed through to the Fund via its integrated oil stocks &ndash; Royal Dutch Shell and BP &ndash; as well as companies providing engineering products and support services to the sector, including <strong>Wood Group</strong> (+20.2%), <strong>Rotork</strong> (+13.6%) and <strong>Weir Group</strong> (+10.4%). Wood Group&rsquo;s rise was also helped by the news that its tie-up with Amec Foster Wheeler had been approved by the UK&rsquo;s Competition and Markets Authority.</p>
        <p>The Fund&rsquo;s consumer goods stocks came under pressure during the month due to the market rotation away from companies with defensive appeal and a reversal of last month&rsquo;s sterling weakness. The pound appreciated after the Bank of England&rsquo;s MPC commented that &ldquo;some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months&rdquo; when voting 7-2 to leave rates unchanged. The four largest detractors from Fund performance were affected due to their international footprints: <strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> (-7.1%), <strong>Diageo</strong> (-5.4%), <strong>Unilever</strong> (-4.4%), and <strong>Compass Group</strong> (-4.2%).</p>
        <p>Diageo&rsquo;s share price retracement &ndash; which should be viewed in the context of large YTD gains and a good reaction to late-July results &ndash; was not helped by some trading commentary issued ahead of an AGM. While reiterating its three-year revenue and operating margin goals, the drinks company outlined some shorter-term headwinds which include the later timing of Chinese New Year, the Indian ban on liquor sales near highways and the company&rsquo;s increased investment in US Spirits and Scotch.</p>
        <p>Company newsflow otherwise took second billing in September. Both <strong>Emis Group </strong>(-4.8%) and <strong>Gamma Communications </strong>(-5.9%) gave up some ground in the wake of interim results, which smacked of profit taking given the strong run experienced by both since their corresponding trading statements. &nbsp;<strong>Domino&rsquo;s Pizza Group</strong> (+14.7%) has slid lower in 2017 as evidence of a slowing in the business&rsquo;s remarkable growth rate has resulted in earnings estimate downgrades. However, shares in the company received a boost in September after it announced the initiation of a share buyback programme of up to &pound;15m. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p>Wood Group (+20.2%), Domino&rsquo;s Pizza Group (+14.7%), Rotork (+13.6%), AstraZeneca (+9.1%) and BP (+7.2%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors included:</strong></p>
        <p>Reckitt Benckiser (-7.1%), Diageo (-5.4%), Unilever (-4.4%), Compass Group (-4.2%) and RELX (-3.2%)</p>

        &bull; Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</div>

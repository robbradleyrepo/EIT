        <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>South Korea provided the biggest contribution to the Fund’s strong quarterly return, followed by Taiwan. So far 2017 has seen enormous divergence in individual stock movements. After a tough start to the year there were a number of companies in the portfolio that suddenly re-rated in the third quarter.</li>
            <li>Behind the stronger regional performance is a broad improvement in economic data. This probably began with China’s second quarter GDP coming in at 6.9%, ahead of expectations despite earlier Chinese tightening.</li>
            <li>Within the Fund’s geographical remit the countries not participating in the current concerted global growth recovery are India and Australia. The Fund has relatively low weightings in these two countries, leading to positive attribution in the quarter.</li>
            <li>Our outlook remains positive for the region, and we feel that a global environment of muted inflation with low but stable growth should allow Asian equities to continue to perform well given their combination of value and growth.</li>

        <p>South Korea provided the biggest contribution to the Fund’s positive quarterly return, followed by Taiwan. The Fund’s relatively low weightings in Australia and India also aided performance.</p>
        <p>So far 2017 has seen enormous divergence in individual stock movements. After a tough start to the year there were a number of companies in the portfolio that suddenly took off in the third quarter. Foremost among these was KWG, a Chinese property company that rose 56% in sterling terms over three months, then Kingboard Laminates, again Chinese but a manufacturer of electronic materials, up 29%. Four other of the Fund’s holdings also rose by more than 20% in the period: Tianneng Power and Anta Sports in China, Lotes, a Taiwanese component manufacturer, and LG Chemical in South Korea.</p>
        <p>None of the companies mentioned above had performed particularly well in the run up to the third quarter, and performance from there appeared more a result of changing investor focus rather than any shift in fundamentals. Of the five biggest attributors over the third quarter interestingly only one of them, Anta, is in the MSCI Asia ex Japan and Asia Pacific ex Japan indices that we use to assess performance for the Fund. This pattern of returns is not unusual given the significant mid-cap exposure of the Fund, and highlights the importance for us of having a long-term outlook for equity investment.</p>
        <p>Behind the stronger performance is a broad improvement in economic data. This probably began with China’s second quarter GDP coming in at 6.9%, ahead of expectations despite earlier Chinese tightening. Most countries' exports significantly surpassed expectations and industrial production numbers also grew more than analysts had predicted. There continues a combination of relatively benign inflation, stable interest rates, and decent growth. The only interest rate policy changes in the quarter was a small cut by India and two small cuts by Indonesia.</p>
        <p>While growth is good, China continues with its own idiosyncratic policies, so far successfully juggling a multitude of targets. The government clearly remains concerned about financial risks, with the property sector one potential source. In an attempt to address this, limits were placed on secondary sales in eight provinces. Equally important are the reductions in debt-dependent overcapacity, which seem to be having some traction. For us, the strongest sign that the government retains control of the financial situation comes from ongoing rises in foreign exchange reserves, an indication that last year’s fears of rampant capital flight were misplaced. Although restrictions on capital leaving the country remain tight, we have also seen recent signs of a larger number of international Chinese deals being approved.</p>
        <p>At the same time the Chinese government is happy to see more progress in infrastructure investment. This seems a sensible if not game-changing path to follow, and is happening across the region. We saw a number of Chinese initiatives mooted or executed along these lines, encouraging state-owned financial and large logistics companies to set up funds for infrastructure investment as well as engaging more insurance companies to fund the nation’s major strategies. The Taiwanese government approved a TWD108.9bn special budget for the first stage of its&nbsp; ‘forward looking infrastructure plan’, while the Thai military government approved US$5.2bn to build the first stage of a high-speed railway which will ultimately link Bangkok to Southern China. In India the Ministry of Housing is considering market borrowings to incentivise speedy execution of urban infrastructure projects. The country is also using Japan for new high-speed railway.</p>
        <p>Within our remit the countries not participating in the current concerted global growth recovery are India and Australia. Second quarter GDP was just 5.7% in India, the slowest pace since 2014 as companies reduced inventories prior to the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax. India’s GDP growth has slowed for five consecutive quarters, with analysts consequently cutting earnings expectations from 19.2% annual growth at the start of the year to only 9.5% now.</p>
        <p>To improve things the RBI cut interest rates by 0.25% in August, and Modi continues to try to pass long-needed structural reforms. Our belief remains that reform will be a long process, however, and one that the equity market is too optimistic about execution. Clogged bank balance sheets and low industry capacity utilisation means that private capex will still be weak in the near term. However, with the upcoming general elections in 2019, we expect government spending to increase, especially in areas of infrastructure and affordable housing. We will continue to add to our position should further opportunities come available at attractive prices, but we believe we have time to wait for those to arise.</p>
        <p>Following our increase in India and South Korea in the second quarter – both were positive in contribution for the third quarter – we added another holding to South Korea, DGB Financial, but otherwise there were few, stock specific changes. Our key country exposure remains to the markets of Hong Kong and China, Taiwan and Thailand, where we think equities offer greater value.</p>
        <p>For the changes we did make, we sold Supalai in Thailand as the company surprised the market by suspending its dividend and announced a warrant issuance aimed at reducing its net gearing from 88% in the second quarter to a 60-80% range. Earnings visibility remains solid with over 80% of 2017 revenue secured but the suspension of a dividend against our expectations of a 4.4% yield has led us to switch into alternative investments. We also sold our position in Jiangnan in China. Sub-quality supplies of cable by one of its competitors has led to tightening quality standards and rejection rates for the whole industry, an issue which is likely to persist for several months and reduce margins. Maintaining our position in China we added China State Construction, a beneficiary of the ongoing infrastructure spending we mentioned above.</p>
        Our outlook remains positive for the region, and we feel that a global environment of muted inflation with low but stable growth should allow Asian equities to continue to perform well given their combination of value and growth.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>So, where to start?</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span>German 10 year yields moved into negative territory for only the second time in history.</span></li>
            <li><span>Australian yields fell to all-time lows.</span></li>
            <li><span>The US yield curve inverted at the short end and steepened in longer dates.</span></li>
            <li><span>UK yields fell below 1%.</span></li>
            <li><span>The difference in yield between US and Canadian bonds hit an all-time high.</span></li>
            <li><span>Most G7 bond markets are pricing for recession and rate cuts.</span></li>
            <li><span>Corporate bonds, high yield debt and equity markets didn’t seem to notice.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>In an attempt to give context to the madness of market pricing I undertook some admittedly rudimentary analysis on how bonds currently compensate investors in real terms compared with the past 100 years. Based on 10 year yields and current inflation, I found that German bonds are as expensive as they’ve ever been in the past century; UK bonds have only been more expensive 10% of the time; for US bonds the figure is 20%; and in Australia bonds are more expensive than all but 5% of the last century. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>I’ve also taken a broad look at current global macro conditions, finding that current data suggest we are nowhere near Great Depression or Global Financial Crisis conditions and instead sit somewhere above zero growth conditions but below a trend growth scenario. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Bonds are ridiculously expensive in absolute terms and even more so when adjusted for inflation. Fundamental economics would need to collapse to justify buying bonds. A combination of fear and, more importantly, technical factors have driven yields to stupid levels. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>To try to summarise the technical factors driving markets is difficult. At the risk of sounding glib there are simply more buyers than sellers! Many of those buyers are price insensitive. Asset-liability matchers can be forced by regulation to buy more bonds as prices rise. The same is true of index trackers and ETFs, while active managers often are forced to buy as the indices they benchmark against “lengthen”. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Rates</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br>So how have we played this? Well, we could have collapsed duration to zero as many markets surged to all-time, inflation-adjusted highs. Instead we just trimmed duration a little. In the short term we do have to respect this massive technical demand coupled with a starting point that saw many active managers underweight (ourselves included). Together this created a powerful, self-sustaining loop which is still playing out as we enter the second quarter of 2019. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Where could sovereign rates go? That is almost impossible to predict. They are already way too expensive for macroeconomic conditions. Until the current technical situation plays out then the easy answer has to be that yields could go lower still. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>There is little point looking to central banks for guidance. Frankly I am staggered at the extent to which a dozen or so independent institutions have moved from modest monetary tightening to open consideration of policy easing in such a short space of time. It is possible they are being incredibly clever. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We often hear that most recessions are caused by over-aggressive central bank policy. All the evidence suggests that cycles end when rates go up too much. If central bank data predicts a continuation of the current downward trend for manufacturing and production, then modest policy easing could prolong the economic cycle. That raises several questions: </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><span>Is current or forecast activity that bad? Simply, no. IMF and World Bank projections remain for reasonable growth and inflation globally this year and next. Most G7 central banks also continue to predict positive growth (and of course financial conditions are much ‘easier’ than they were three months ago).<br><br></span></li>
            <li><span>What could be the impact on inflation? To reiterate, global inflation is close to target and trend. We had a deflation scare four years ago. Despite a collapse in energy prices last year, inflation has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> collapsed. Taking a risk with monetary policy now could stoke inflation and require more aggressive policy action at a later date.<br><br></span></li>
            <li><span>Is the Fed too concerned with financial asset prices? Policy change was coincident to a 10% fall in US equity markets. That was enough to warrant detailed discussion in the corridors of power. Note to the Fed: the S&amp;P 500 is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> the US economy.<br><br></span></li>
            <li><span>Is politics the driving force? Trump and Powell are not best buddies – surely it is more than coincidence that a month after the President said the Fed was the biggest danger to the US economy, Powell turned from hawk to dove. And in Europe, Draghi seems much more concerned with peripheral spread stability than managing for the core. </span></li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We are way into unintended consequences territory with rates; French life assurance guarantees are now below inflation, Draghi is considering bailing out banks impacted by negative deposit rates and zombie companies survive as their cost of capital collapses.</span><br></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>It is difficult to see where and when the regime change comes from. My best hope and guess at salvation is from wage inflation and the labour market in general. Earnings are way above inflation in all G7 countries, and employment is high. If this does filter through to inflation then perhaps it will help central bankers and many bond investors realise the folly of extended market manipulation and record high prices. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span>We remain light duration against neutral levels, both ours and the market’s.</span></li>
            <li><span>We prefer (as opposed to like) the US to Europe on a relative value basis.</span></li>
            <li><span>We want to “short” European markets but can’t yet oppose the strong technical demand.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Allocation</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br>We retained our underweight position in most parts of the market. Rates, per my comments above remained light at around 2 years adjusted duration<sup>†</sup> (neutral for us is 4.5 years).</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Investment grade credit continued to trade well despite the macroeconomic noise. We didn’t see the big move tighter in spreads of January and February. That was to be expected given the market had moved close to fair value. Our overall weight to investment grade ranged from 35-42%. In addition we have a hedge reducing exposure by around 8% (note the beta of this hedge is low so in reality we’d adjust it to about 5%, meaning our overall weight has been in the 30-37% range). Our neutral through-the-cycle exposure is about 50%. We continued to reduce higher beta, longer maturity credit. There is little added return from buying long bonds and risk and volatility are higher. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The Fund’s high yield bond weight did not exceed 15% during the month. We feel the market is modestly over bought – reflected in year-to-date performance of around 7% in US dollar terms. We like holding some core high yield names in the portfolio. They provide diversification but are also generally a good, long-term asset if a little prone to volatility. Our intention is to keep our core in this range and add should we see macro-induced generic price weakness. Seldom is it a bad time to own high yield and in the coming quarter there may be a time to tactically overweight.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Emerging markets benefited from a weaker US dollar. We moved back to zero weight although towards month end we did consider shorting again as Turkish liquidity problems reappeared. For now, we prefer to wait on the side-lines given emerging markets is an asset class we don’t need to own. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br>Overall we remain happy with the core names in the Fund.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We conducted a bit of housekeeping on a few rates markets. In particular we reduced a short 5 year/ long 10 year position in German debt. We were nervous German rates would fall and this trade has often been directional, 10 years doing better than 5 years in a bull market. We put the position on at a spread of 60 and closed at 40 when Bunds moved inside a 0.1% yield. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We sold the remainder of our Australian bonds, purely on value. We were a couple of days too early but even with hindsight feel it was better to travel than arrive. We reduced our exposure to 3 year US bonds where yields suggested the Federal Reserve would cut rates twice this year. We switched into inflation-linked securities which had modestly underperformed in the bull rally. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The early part of the month saw a number of larger, global new issues. We considered several of these but primary market pricing was quite aggressive and we saw little value in most of the names on offer. We did add some core shorter maturity investment grade debt though, with March Mercer 7 year bonds a prime example. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>High yield activity was light, both in the market and for the Fund. We expected supply to follow the increase in prices in January and February but that didn’t really happen. However, if yields stay low and spreads tight, we would expect a number of attractive new issues in Q2.</span></p>

        <strong>Key Risks</strong><strong><br>
        <br>
        </strong>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.<br>

        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>The Fund returned -0.2%* in sterling terms in June compared with the -0.7% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; background: white;">The MSCI World fell 0.2% in sterling terms in June. Having made strong gains since the start of the year, global equities took a pause for breath.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Central banks had the market’s attention for much of June. The US Federal Reserve continued its tightening cycle with another 25 basis point increase to US rates. ECB President Mario Draghi talked up the strength of the eurozone economy, noting that “deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones”. This raised expectations in the market that a withdrawal of the bank’s substantial stimulus was nearing, which sent the euro higher. Though the ECB claimed the market misjudged Draghi’s speech, the euro still closed the month 1.1% higher in trade weighted terms. The Bank of England also provided hawkish signals, with Chief Economist Andy Haldane seemingly contradicting Governor Mark Carney by suggesting UK rates should rise. </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The effect of the perceived hawkishness by key central banks was also visible in the bond market with yields moving higher. UK 10-year government bond yields rose 20 basis points to 1.3% in June and US 10-year yields rose 10 basis points to 2.3%. </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In the UK, there was a surprise outcome in the general election with Theresa May’s Conservatives losing their majority in parliament, with Labour performing better than expected. The result made a dent in the pound but equities were largely resilient.&nbsp; </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Oil prices were again in focus with Brent touching its lowest level since November 2016 at US$44.82 a barrel as US shale producers continued to upscale production in the wake of Opec output cuts in May. Crude prices began rebounding towards the end of June, but the North Sea benchmark still ended the month 4.8% lower. Of the Fund’s energy holdings, <strong>Fred Olsen Energy </strong>(-23.0%) and <strong>Total </strong>(-6.6%) were affected. </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The energy sector (-2.4%) was among the detractors from the MSCI World Index in June. Others included telecoms (-4.5%), utilities (-3.7%) and consumer staples (-3.3%). Financials (+3.7%), health care (+1.7%) and materials (+0.5%) were the only contributors.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong>Genworth MI Canada</strong> led the Fund’s contributors (+20.3%). The Canadian private residential mortgage insurer rose after Warren Buffett agreed to provide financing for troubled mortgage lender Home Capital Group, boosting shares of alternative lenders and banks across Canada.</p>
        <p><strong>Air New Zealand </strong>(+9.8%)<strong> </strong>saw its share price increase after noting at the end of May in an investor day that it expects its earnings before tax to exceed NZ$525m in its 2017 financial year. This was an upgrade from the NZ$475m to NZ$525m range it guided towards in its interims in February. </p>
        <p>Hong Kong-listed apparel retailer <strong>Giordano International</strong> (+8.9%) noted that the strong performance in the first quarter has continued into the second, due to improvements in merchandise offering, effective promotion activities and an early Ramadan. The company additionally announced that it will launch a share repurchase plan.</p>
        <p>A detractor from the Fund in June was <strong>Man Wah Holdings</strong> (-11.1%) after a high profile short seller raised concerns about the Hong Kong-based furniture company’s liabilities. Man Wah subsequently stated that the allegations made by the investor are “groundless” and contained “obvious factual errors”, helping the stock to regain some losses. </p>
        <p><strong>EDP-Energias de Portugal</strong> (-9.9%) was another detractor after it stated that its offices were visited by the Portuguese general attorney in relation to the transition to the new contractual stability compensation regime (CMEC) in 2004. Portugal’s public prosecutor said the investigation was linked to the compensation the state paid to EDP for giving up some long-term power-purchase contracts during this transition. </p>
        <p>Our annual review of companies’ reports and accounts, which drives the majority of portfolio changes within the Cashflow Solution fund range was completed in May. However, the yield objective of the Income Fund makes it prudent to consider the dividend payment calendar of our companies when managing the annual restructuring of the portfolio. Therefore portfolio changes are phased according to the timing of dividend receipts. </p>
        <p>The result of this phasing is that changes to the Income Fund tend to take place across both Q2 and Q3, slightly later than for the other Cashflow Solution Funds. In June, the following stocks were added to the Fund: Air New Zealand, ASR Nederland, Bank of China (Hong Kong), King's Town Bank, McMillan Shakespeare, O2 Czech Republic and RMB Holdings.</p>
        <p>The following stocks were sold from the Fund: APG SGA, Banque Cantonale Vaudoise, Bpost, Medical Facilities, NN Group, Restaurant Brands and SATS. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0cm; background: white;">Genworth MI Canada (+20.3%), Air New Zealand (+9.8%) and Giordano International (+8.9%).<strong></strong></p>
        <p style="background: white;"><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0cm; background: white;">Man Wah Holdings (-11.1%), Seagate Technology (-10.5%) and EDP-Energias de Portugal (-9.9%).</p>

        <p> • Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.&nbsp; The Liontrust European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio which could mean that it will be volatile when compared to its benchmark. The Liontrust Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.<br>

        <strong>For investment professionals only<br />
        </strong><br />
        <strong>
        The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned 3.7%* in December. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index returned 6.1%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned 3.3% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was 4.2%.</strong><br />
        <br />
        The final month of 2016 saw strong returns across UK indices, driven particularly by oil-related sectors after a long-awaited OPEC deal to cap supply. UK economic data was also bullish as December&rsquo;s composite Purchasing Managers Index data printed at a 17 month high, pointing to a positive Q4 GDP number in spite of the lack of a clear plan for Brexit as we enter 2017.<br />
        <br />
        The fund added one new position in the month, Marlowe, which provides critical fire protection, security and water treatment services to a broad range of customers. The requirement for accreditation creates significant barriers to entry into the market, while regulation underpins demand. Thus Marlowe is able to generate a high level of recurring revenues on long-term contracts.<br />
        <br />
        The largest share price rise in the month came from D4T4 Solutions (+32.3%), which reported for the first time since its recent rebrand from IS Solutions. It enjoyed a strong first half, driven by project work, software licences sales and a currency boost (78% of sales are in US dollars) as it continues to focus on helping clients collect, manage and analyse data across a variety of industries. The house broker added the company is &ldquo;well on track&rdquo; to meet profit before tax forecasts in 2017 and boosted its FY2018 estimate by 5%.<br />
        <br />
        Life was tougher for geospatial data expert 1Spatial (-28.6%), which warned it was likely to slip into loss this year having previously forecast a profit. It stated that some sales cycles have extended, meaning that some revenues which had been expected in 2016 would now slip into 2017. The company has been struggling recently as it attempts to transition its business model to one with a higher degree of recurring revenue, and on the last day of the year news broke that the CEO had resigned, with the CFO stepping up for an interim period.<br />
        <br />
        Other fallers in the month included security specialist Croma Security Solutions (-6.9%) which slipped despite a healthy set of final results released at the end of November, which saw double-digit growth in both revenue and profits and was swiftly followed by a brace of contract wins. Lettings franchise Belvoir Lettings (-4.9%), supplier of veterinary medicines Animalcare (-2.9%) and spend-control software provider Proactis (-2.6%) all edged lower without obvious catalysts.<br />
        <br />
        Crimson Tide (+26%) provides enterprise mobile solutions under its mpro5 platform. It reported healthy trading up to year end, with revenues in-line but profit expected to have &ldquo;more than doubled&rdquo;, guidance which exceeded consensus market forecasts at the time of the announcement. Crimson Tide recently announced its largest contract to date with a major UK supermarket, which should boost revenue visibility for future years.<br />
        <br />
        <p>Acquisitions drove the share prices of ULS Technology (+24.1%) and Ideagen (+21.5%). The former, a provider of online B2B platforms for the UK conveyancing and financial intermediary markets, announced it was buying Conveyancing Alliance Holdings &ndash; one of its major competitors in the space. The &pound;7.2m all-cash deal is expected to be significantly earnings accretive in the first full year of ownership, and prompted double-digit upgrades to analyst earnings forecasts for the year ending March 2018. Ideagen supplies Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) software to highly regulated industries. In December, it announced the addition of IPI Solutions to its stable. IPI&rsquo;s main product is &lsquo;Visual IP&rsquo;, a software platform which provides quality and compliance reporting, extending the reach of the Ideagen product suite into manufacturing industry processes. The deal announcement comes on the back of a positive trading update early in November, and led to further analyst earnings upgrades.</p>
        <p>
        The final move of note for the month came from Netcall (+14.2%), a provider of customer engagement software.&nbsp;In an AGM statement toward the end of November the group commented on &ldquo;continued strong trading in the&nbsp;first few months of the financial year&rdquo;. Encouragingly, an increasing proportion of these sales are on a multiyear&nbsp;recurring basis.</p>
        <p>As markets head into an unpredictable and potentially unsettled 2017, the Fund will not waver from the&nbsp;investment approach applied in 2016. It will continue to seek to invest in profitable companies which enjoy&nbsp;pricing power thanks to their intangible barriers to competition &ndash; intellectual property, distribution networks&nbsp;and repeat business &ndash; and which are backed by high levels of management ownership.</p>

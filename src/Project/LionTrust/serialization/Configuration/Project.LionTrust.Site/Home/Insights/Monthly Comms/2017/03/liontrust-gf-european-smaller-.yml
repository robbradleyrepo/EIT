        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>The Fund&rsquo;s A5 share class returned 0.86%* in euro terms from launch on 1 February through to the end of the month (A4 share class 0.80%). This compares with the 2.0% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index.</strong></span></p>
        <p>The Fund was fully invested by month end, holding a portfolio of 38 pan-European small cap stocks, all of which had a market capitalisation at inception of less than &euro;5bn. As with all funds and portfolios managed in accordance with the Cashflow Solution investment process, we have aimed to identify companies that generate significant free cash flows from their asset base and are lowly valued on their cash flows whilst being run by company managers who allocate their cash flows in an intelligent way. </p>
        <p>The rally seen in stock markets in recent months carried on in full force in February: the S&amp;P 500 Index rose 3.7% (US dollar terms), again reaching a new peak of 2369 on 27 February. In Europe, the mood was similarly upbeat with the MSCI Europe Index rising 2.9% in February (euro terms).</p>
        <p>After months of being dominated by political events and related news flow, global stock markets were influenced by more fundamental factors with a busy corporate results season and the release of macro data that included a strong UK Q4 GDP reading, higher-than-expected French and German PMI data and surprisingly strong Chinese trade data. This fundamental focus may be a short-lived trend as forthcoming elections in Germany, the Netherlands and France &ndash; as well as the resumption of Greek debt bailout talks &ndash; remain very much in investors&rsquo; thoughts. </p>
        <p>Moves in US sovereign debt were quite muted during the month - the yield on US 10 year Treasury bills fell 5bps to 2.39%. In contrast, in Europe, moves were more pronounced with the yield on the German 10 year bund falling 24bps during the month to 0.21% and reversing nearly all of January&rsquo;s gains.&nbsp; Similarly, UK 10 year gilt yields declined 27bps to 1.15%. Sterling weakened by 1.5% against the US dollar and was broadly unchanged versus the euro. </p>
        <p>Sector performance was mostly positive across the MSCI Europe Index. The strongest performing sectors were healthcare, up 6.5%, consumer staples up 6.1% and information technology, up 5.8% in euro terms. The weakest performing sectors included financials (-0.3%), energy (-0.2%) and materials (+0.6%).</p>
        <p>The portfolio&rsquo;s top contributor during the month was Oriflame, the Swedish consumer goods company. Its shares rose 37% following the publication of better-than-expected full year financial results, which showed evidence of strong growth in local currency sales, margin improvement, debt pay down and an extra dividend.</p>
        <p>Danish shipping line operator DFDS (+14.0%) was another holding to rally on the release of full year results. The company reported 27% growth in 2016 EBITDA to DKK2.6bn. DFDS saw freight volumes and passenger numbers increase by 21% and 12% respectively. It announced a 33% increase in dividends to DKK8 per share, as well as two DKK800m share buyback programmes. In 2017, it expects 4% revenue growth and a further increase in EBITDA, with a guidance range of DKK2.6-2.8bn.</p>
        <p>Mining company Centamin (+8.6%) produced over 551,000 ounces of gold in 2016, a 26% increase on 2015 and above the range it had predicted. Production costs fell, down almost $200 an ounce to $694/ounce, better than the company had forecast. This helped boost EBITDA by 145% to US$373m. In January, the company updated its dividend policy to target a payout of at least 30% of free cash flow, and for 2016 it declared an amount equivalent to a payout ratio of around 70%. </p>
        <p>Shares in AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group, a specialty metals and vacuum furnace producer, also performed strongly, rallying 18%. There was no significant corporate news flow but the shares outperformed the modest rise in the general metals, mining and materials sector. </p>
        <p>Cembra Money Bank (+7.9%) was another portfolio highlight even though 2016 revenues grew just 1% to CHF394m in 2016 while income before taxes dropped 1% to CHF181.9m. The company described the Swiss credit market as subdued, but highlighted the good growth experienced by its credit card business, where net financing receivables rose 15% driven by an increase in the number of cards, higher average spending and a rise in transactions. The company&rsquo;s balance sheet remains robust when compared to its banking peers; its Tier 1 ratio is 20%. It is proposing a final dividend distribution per share of CHF4.45, which includes an extraordinary dividend of CHF1.</p>
        <p>Turning our attention to the portfolio detractors, one of the largest was Banco BPM (-10.8%), a portfolio holding which was formed through the merger of Banco Popolare and Banca Popolare di Milano on 1 January 2017. Its first set of consolidated results as a combined entity showed clear evidence of a tough operating environment via a net loss of &euro;1.6bn. The company is, however, responding by cutting back operating costs and attempting to de-risk its bad loan book.</p>
        <p>Nexans (-9.4%) was another company to see its shares soften on the back of results. It suffered a 1.2% organic decrease in sales volumes of its cables, primarily the result of weakness in the oil &amp; gas and mining sectors. It did, however, secure a higher operating margin. In 2017 it expects to register a further improvement in operating margin and return to sales growth. </p>
        <p>2016 results from industrial conglomerate NKT (-7.2%) showed a mixed performance as solid growth in its photonics and professional cleaning divisions was offset by a 10% fall in its cables revenues. The business is due to undergo significant change in 2017; in February it received EU Commission approval for the deal to acquire ABB&rsquo;s high voltage cables business, which it plans to combine with its own cables division and spin-off into a separately listed company, and announced a new CEO for Nilfisk, the professional cleaning company which will form the other listed company.</p>
        <p>Although Opec indicated that its cuts had reduced oil market surplus quicker than it expected, the energy sector lagged the wider market&rsquo;s in February, affecting some of the portfolio&rsquo;s holdings. Soco International (-15.3%) also released results showing its average realised crude oil price in 2016 was $45/barrel on net production of 9,983 boepd (barrels of oil equivalent per day), slightly below the 10,000 boepd lower end of its guidance range. 2017&rsquo;s production levels will be negatively affected by shutdowns for maintenance, rig moves and equipment installation, resulting in the company setting an 8,000 &ndash; 9,000 boepd range. Tullow Oil (-10.7%) announced that its 2016 operating loss had widened to $755m, worse than expectations. This was largely the result of a $723m exploration cost write-off; operating cash flow of $774 should help it service its substantial debt. </p>
        <p>It was a better story for Fred Olsen Energy (+21.0%), an oil rig operator that announced a reduced annual operating loss of US$23m (down from $325m in 205). Following a year of depressed oil prices which led to a softening of the offshore drilling market, the outlook for the company has recently improved: oil prices have recovered, two of its rig contracts have been renewed and it reached agreement with its bondholders to waive certain covenants. </p>

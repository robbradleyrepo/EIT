        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund returned 0.5%* in euro terms in March, compared with the 3.3% return from the MSCI Europe Index and the 0.5% return of the HFRX Equity Hedge EUR Index.</strong></p>
        <p>The solid performance from the Fund&rsquo;s long book continued in March as positive share price momentum was sustained across a number of holdings which had published full year and fourth quarter 2016 financial results. A negative contribution from the short book mostly reflected the risk-on environment across European stocks.</p>
        <p>In Europe, the rally seen in stock markets in recent months continued strongly in March with the MSCI Europe Index rising 3.3% (euro terms). However, the environment in the US was slightly more subdued with the S&amp;P 500 Index broadly flat (US dollar terms) over the month. Perhaps not surprisingly investors paused for breath following the 5.9% rally in the index since the start of the year and the 11% rally since the election of a new president on 8 November last year. Indeed, since its peak on 1 March this year, the index declined 1.4% as investors increasingly looked for evidence that the president can deliver on the election rhetoric for improved growth and infrastructure spend. The healthcare reform debacle (the failure by Trump to repeal Barack Obama&rsquo;s healthcare law) did little to ease investors&rsquo; rising concerns. In Europe, the mood was much more upbeat. While the UK formally triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon and subsequently started the negotiation process for the UK&lsquo;s exit from the European Union, this had been well flagged and largely discounted by markets. Instead, investors in Europe focused on increasingly positive macro data. This included strong PMI data, a narrowing of the output gap, and the interpretation by some market participants of a less dovish tone in comments from ECB President Mario Draghi. </p>
        <p>Sector performance was positive across the MSCI Europe Index. The strongest performing sectors were Utilities (+5.4%), Financials (+5.2%) and Information Technology (+4.9%), all in euro terms. The weakest performing sectors included Real Estate (+1.1%), Energy (+1.5%) and Materials (+1.9%).</p>
        <p>In the Fund&rsquo;s long book, the strongest performer was Burford Capital, the UK based litigation financing company. The shares rose 13% during the month following the publication of strong full year financial results. This included a 75% increase in net profits and strong organic cash generation leading to a 14% rise in the annual dividend. New litigation finance investment commitments rose 83% to US$378m in 2016 and analysts subsequently upgraded earnings forecasts for 2017. Vestra Wind Systems, the Danish wind turbine manufacturer, was another stronger performer. The shares rose 10% during the month following various contract wins in Germany, Austria, the US and the Ukraine. The shares may also have rallied on some relief that the Trump administration&rsquo;s energy policy could still allow for growth in clean energy. Straumann, the Swiss based dental implants company, also contributed positively to the long book&rsquo;s performance. While there was no significant corporate news flow during the month the rally in shares continued from February &ndash; when the company published good full year results.</p>
        <p>There were no major negative contributors to the long book during the month. A modest negative contribution again came from some holdings in the energy sector, for example, Tullow Oil following the announcement of a large share placing at a deep discount. </p>
        <p>One of the more significant positive contributions in the short book came from a UK company that funds early stage start-ups in the life sciences and technology sectors. &nbsp;The shares fell following the news that the co-founder/ CEO would step aside. An interim CEO has been appointed. </p>
        <p>A detractor from performance in the short book was a US-based beverages company. While the Fund only has a relatively small position in the stock, the shares rose strongly as the company announced a supply agreement with a large US retail company. </p>

        <p>&bull; Past performance is not a guide to future performance. &bull; Do remember that the value of an investment and the income from it can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.&nbsp;&bull; Some of the Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team invest in smaller companies. These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. &bull; The European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio which could mean that it will be volatile when compared to its benchmark. &bull; The Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.</p>

Never mind a two year low versus the US dollar, on a trade weighted basis sterling isn’t far off its lowest point this century.</span> </span></strong></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Why then is everyone still rushing to buy gilts? The UK two year gilt yield has contracted by 30 basis points over the last three months to trade at 0.46%.</span></p>

        If markets are pricing in a greater likelihood of a Bank of England rate cut, this has some worrying implications for inflation. The currency has already done its job as a free-floating exchange rate, falling to cushion UK economic performance from the uncertainties of recent years.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br>
        I spent a few years studying international economics – but I must have been off the day they taught that rate cuts are the appropriate response to currency weakness. To cut rates at a time when real wages are rising risks stoking inflation and accelerating the pound’s plunge. Mind you, it could be a brilliant trick to inflate away the UK's debt burden, great news unless you own gilts already (which we don’t). It could also help support our shiny new PM’s desire to increase fiscal spend, with sterling weakness translating to a higher tax take from FTSE 100 companies’ overseas earnings.</span></p>

        One final thought: the chart above shows that the NHS now needs to pay £1bn to buy drugs that cost it £800m in 2015.&nbsp;This is </span><em style="font-size: 1.5rem;">not</em><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> a political comment, this is a </span><em style="font-size: 1.5rem;">fact</em><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> (remember when we cared about those?).</span></p>

        <p><strong>Key Risks </strong></p>
        <p>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The majority of the Liontrust Sustainable Future Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Some of these funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and has a concentrated portfolio of securities, there is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund’s share price. Liontrust SF Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Corporate Bond Fund, Liontrust SF Cautious Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Defensive Managed Fund and Liontrust Monthly Income Bond Fund invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions, it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the bonds held by these funds. Mentioned above five funds can also invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interests rates move or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions.</p>

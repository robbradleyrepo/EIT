        <p class="Body" style="text-align: left;">The Liontrust GF Absolute Return Bond Fund (C5 share class) returned 0.6%* in sterling terms in Q2 2019 versus the IA Targeted Absolute Return sector average of 1.2%. The primary US dollar share class (B5) returned 1.0%.<span> </span></p>
        <p><span>The period was characterised by weak global manufacturing data but resilient services activity and consumer spending. The root cause of this is the ongoing trade disputes between the US and, currently, China. </span></p>
        <p><span>After the financial markets’ tariff tantrum in May came the soothing words of central bankers in June. Practically all asset classes reacted positively to the reassurance that the central banking “put” is alive and well. After all, who needs capital and infrastructure investment or productivity growth when you’ve got cheap money?</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The Federal Reserve’s dovishness has emboldened other central banks who are joining in, and the cynic in me says this is partly due to preventing currency appreciation against the US dollar. The Fed’s dot plots have been revised down and the market anticipates a rate cut at its July meeting. This has been referred to by some Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members as an “insurance cut” and with the market pricing in a 33 basis points (bps) decrease, there are clearly some that think this insurance will take the form of a 50bps cut.</span><br></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The “will the Fed cut” question looks like a foregone conclusion, the “should the Fed cut” question is far more interesting. The short answer, in my opinion, is no. Recent economic data has undoubtedly been weaker than expectations and this can be clearly seen by looking at the economic surprise indices, which are deep into negative territory.</span><br></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">However, this has been led by the manufacturing sector around the world. Trade and tariff wars have hurt sentiment: there is a large gap between surveys of current conditions and expected future conditions and they have also impacted activity levels and led to big inventory swings. The latter point is one of those classic, easy to predict outcomes: if you tell people tariffs on imports are going up in a few months’ time, they will stock up ahead of that.</span><br></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The key is that the service sectors are still strong and employment remains robust. Of course, there will be some contagion from manufacturing to services, but this really is a case of the metaphorical tail wagging the dog. If a resolution can be reached on the trade front, then the markets can start focusing on the strength of consumer spending and the elevated levels of wage inflation. Building in some form of portfolio protection against a dovish policy mistake is central to our present thinking and the Fund’s positioning.</span><br></p>
        <p><strong><span>Carry Component</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>As highlighted in the previous quarter’s report, we increased the weighting in US dollar floating rate notes to approximately a third of the total assets. With the US Treasury market now discounting four rate cuts in the next 12 months and government bond yields significantly below overnight rates, we receive a far better yield on floating rate debt. </span></p>
        <p><span>Obviously, floating rate yields will come down as rate cuts happen but we don’t believe the US economy needs all the cuts the market is predicting. The rest of the Carry Component is in conventional short-dated debt with fixed coupons; there is a slightly higher weighting in the US and the duration contribution of the European credit is hedged out using five-year German government futures (Bobls). </span></p>
        <p><span>The Carry Component has good diversity across sectors and issuers, with a total of 110 bonds making up the Fund’s carry at the end of the second quarter. We anticipate this will be the ballpark area in terms of the number of holdings for the foreseeable future: as the Fund grows, we will top up existing positions and when bonds mature we will replace them accordingly.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Alpha sources</span></strong></p>
        <p><strong><span>Rates</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>We took profits in the Fund’s 10s30s US curve steepener in April: this meant being long 10-year US Treasury futures and short 30-year US Treasury futures with a net neutral duration contribution. We continue to be concerned about inflation and have expressed this with a breakeven position: the Fund owns a Treasury Inflation Protected Security (TIPS) and has sold the same duration contribution of Treasury futures against this. </span></p>
        <p><span>Since instigation, breakevens have reduced and inflation expectations have fallen but we continue to believe in the position and it has not reached the 10 basis points stop loss.</span></p>
        <p><span>Norwegian debt significantly outperformed German debt at the start of June, partly caused by a market squeeze in the former as maturities were reinvested. We took profits and will watch for a good level at which to re-enter this position.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Allocation</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>We continue to manage the Fund in its entirety and have been steadily reducing risk over the quarter as valuations have become more expensive. With the proverbial rising tide lifting all ships during the period, there was not enough market dislocation to create alpha opportunities.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>Selection was strong during the second quarter of 2019: performance was incremental in nature across a range of holdings with no one credit adding more than five bps. &nbsp;The largest contributor was Altria in euros and the Fund has profitably exited this holding. Other notable mentions include Anheuser Busch’s floating rate notes and a fixed coupon Pershing Square bond in US dollars. </span></p>

        <p><strong><span>Key Risks </span></strong></p>
        <p><span>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The majority of the Liontrust Sustainable Future Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Some of these funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and has a concentrated portfolio of securities, there is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund’s share price. Liontrust SF Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Corporate Bond Fund, Liontrust SF Cautious Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Defensive Managed Fund and Liontrust Monthly Income Bond Fund invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions, it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the bonds held by these funds. Mentioned above five funds can also invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interests rates move or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions.</span></p>

        <p>The Liontrust GF Special Situations Fund returned -1.5%* in October compared with the 0.6% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.<br></p><p><br>The Brexit saga has clearly had another chapter added to it since 31 October, but throughout October the focus was on Theresa May’s indication that Article 50 would be triggered no later than March 2017, and the growing talk of ‘hard Brexit’. This contributed to a 4.2% trade-weighted depreciation of sterling. The implications for imported inflation appear to be reflected in government bond markets where the UK 10 year gilt yield rose 50bps to 1.25%. On the last day of the month, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney confirmed he would stay on in the position until June 2019, quashing rumours that recent events would prompt him to depart earlier.<br></p><p><br>At the time of writing, US election risk is beginning to be realised. In October, markets had moved to price in a higher chance of a Trump victory as his campaign showed resilience in the face of a series of scandals. The VIX Index of volatility on US equities spiked at the end of month as the FBI stated it was reviewing newly discovered emails from Clinton’s stint as Secretary of State. However, one of the busiest months on record in terms of US merger &amp; acquisition activity suggests that the US corporate sector was relatively sanguine regarding political risk. Deals worth over US$500bn were proposed globally in October, of which US$329m related to US companies (source: Dealogic).<br></p><p><br>Although UK economic data continues to show little immediate negative effect from the referendum result (the September Purchasing Managers’ Index showed the biggest monthly rise in two years), the IMF continued to forecast negative consequences, cutting its forecast for UK growth for the second time since the vote. It now expects 1.1% expansion in 2017, down from the 1.3% it forecast in July.<br></p><p><br>The Fund’s most material disappointment in October came from NCC Group (-45.9%), which issued a statement that triggered a large share price fall and accounts for around 0.7% of the Fund’s monthly underperformance of the wider market. Having successfully followed an acquisitive growth policy over the last few years, the cyber security specialist suffered its first major setback as a trading update detailed a difficult integration process for the Fox-IT business and a ‘significant erosion of margin’ within the division formed by its Accumuli acquisition. In addition, it has lost three major contracts and suffered a deferral on another.<br></p><p><br>Much of the remainder of October’s performance differential can be attributed to the Fund’s higher exposure to mid and small cap stocks, at the expense of the strongly rallying large-caps. Encouraged by the tailwinds of weak sterling and stabilising commodity prices, the FTSE100 Index returned 1.0% in October, comparing very favourably against the FTSE 250 Index’s -1.7% performance and the FTSE Small-Cap’s 0.1% return. A significant portion of the large-cap strength derived from basic materials and banks sectors, which was a further headwind for the Fund in light of the absence of such stocks from the portfolio.<br></p><p><br>With no newsflow emanating from the other four detractors listed below – Aggreko (-15.9%), Smart Metering Systems (-12.2%), the AA (-12.2%) and Rightmove (-11.1%) – it seems safe to infer a revival of the negative sentiment towards mid-caps and domestically focused businesses that we saw in the aftermath of EU referendum.<br></p><p><br>A statement from PageGroup (+8.0%) in October painted a strong picture of the post-referendum dynamics experienced by many companies with significant international operations. Although fragile domestic conditions led the recruiter to flag a 4.7% fall in UK gross profit within its Q3 trading statement, the group total rose 14.1%&nbsp;in reported terms to £159m. The positive impact of weaker sterling amounted to £17.8m, or 12.8 percentage points; constant currency growth in gross profits was 1.3%. The company estimates a further positive currency effect of £19m at the gross profit level in Q4 if exchange rates at the time of the announcement persist.<br></p><p><br>Outsourced fund administration provider Sanne Group (+14.9%) announced a move into the strategically important US market via the acquisition of FLSV Fund Administration Services for a cash and shares consideration of around £40m. Investors have fretted about the impact of Brexit on the group given the services it provides to a wide range of key EU jurisdictions, but for now these concerns appear to have taken a back seat and the shares moved higher.<br></p><p><br>RWS Holdings (+14.1%) is a provider of patent translation and other intellectual property support services. The company announced it has enjoyed “best year ever” with revenues to be not less than £122m, up some 28% from 2015. Last year it completed the transformational deal to acquire US based CTi, a provider of linguistic validation in the life sciences niche. The deal has proven well-timed given the predominantly dollar based revenues CTi contributes.<br></p><p><br><b>Positive contributors included:</b></p>

        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned 5.4%* in April, compared with the 3.1% return from the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index.</strong></p>
        <p>Strength in sterling stemming from Theresa May&rsquo;s move to call a snap election held back returns from UK large-caps (FTSE 100 Index -1.3%) and weighed on the capitalisation-weighted FTSE All-Share Index which returned -0.4% in the month. The environment at the small cap and micro cap end of the market was markedly different, with investors showing signs of risk appetite, perhaps buoyed by hopes of a smoother Brexit process if the Conservatives succeed in strengthening their mandate on 8 June. </p>
        <p>Among the portfolio&rsquo;s leading contributors in April were three holdings which reported results for the year ending 31 December 2016: Keyword Studios (+25.7%), Learning Technologies Group (+24.1%) and Mortgage Advice Bureau (+16.5%). Keyword Studios, which provides outsourcing services to the video games industry, grew revenues by 67% year-on-year while gross margins improved to 38%. This helped boost EPS by 61%. Investors will have been encourage by evidence of strong cash generation; the company had net cash of &euro;8.7m at year end even after spending &euro;21.1m on acquisitions during the year, a marked improvement over previous years. </p>
        <p>Learning Technologies Group issued in-line final results and completed the acquisition of AIM-listed learning management solutions provider NetDimensions. Learning Technologies can now provide a full service e-learning offering, including content, analytics, standard interoperability and now owns a system on which to host it.</p>
        <p>Mortgage Advice Bureau is one of the UK&rsquo;s leading networks for mortgage intermediaries. It rallied through May after reporting 23% revenue growth, an 18% rise in underlying earnings as well as strong cash flow. This enabled the company to increase its dividend by 27%, taking its total payout in the year to 18.3p, representing a trailing yield of just under 5%. Mortgage Advice Bureau continues to take market share by growing the number of advisors using its services, allowing it to outperform a relatively flat mortgage market. </p>
        <p>Shares in IMImobile (+24.6%) also made ground after the cloud communications software and solutions provider issued a trading update which struck a positive tone. It stated that profits for the year to end-March were on course to be slightly ahead of market expectations, and commented that cash generation had been strong. IMImobile had suffered a de-rating of its shares during the second half of 2016 due to some exposure to the Nigerian Naira, so this return to form was a welcome reminder that the long-term opportunity remains intact.</p>
        <p>Within the Fund&rsquo;s poorer performers in May, Bango (-11.8%) and Globaldata&rsquo;s (-7.1%) share price weakness can be attributed to some profit-taking following positive reactions to final results in March and February respectively. However, the fall in World Careers Network (-7.1%) followed a downbeat announcement on the last trading day of April. Its interims revealed a 91% year-on-year jump in earnings due to a number of prior-year projects coming on line but the company warned on full year profits, which are now expected to be lower than last year due to a number of issues which may persist into 2018. Specifically, the company cited a significant investment in the cost base, low sales to new clients, and low visibility on future sales.</p>
        <p>Medica Group (+18.4%) &ndash; featured in last month&rsquo;s update &ndash; drifted higher in a benign small-cap environment despite a lack of significant newsflow. </p>
        <p>Having performed well in the wake of its March release of final results, shares in Sanne Group (-4.8%) edged lower as its management team sold a &pound;15m stake at 660p, a large discount to the prevailing share price of close to 700p. Despite management being locked into a 72 month holding period on remaining holdings, this sale &ndash; the first by management since Sanne Group&rsquo;s IPO &ndash; triggered some weakness. </p>
        <p>Plexus Holdings (-5.0%) dipped despite announcing its first purchase order from new Russian partner LCC Gusar, following the recently signed licencing agreement. The order was for its Tersus TRT Mudline System, which supports part of an oil well, at or near the seabed. Although no financials were published, evidence of the venture bearing fruit is encouraging for its long term prospects.</p>

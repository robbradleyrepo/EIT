        <b>For investment professionals only<br><br>&nbsp;The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned -0.3%* in November, compared with the 0.3% return from the FTSE Small Cap excluding investment trusts index.</b><br><br>
        With the FTSE All-Share Index returning -1.6%, dragged down by a 2.0% fall in the FTSE100 index, it is clear that the smaller-cap end of the market’s insulation from macro influences was valuable in November. Trump’s US election victory was responsible for some marked moves in large-cap equity sectors, bond prices and currencies, but the idiosyncratic nature of the small-cap market meant that stock-specific news flow was at least as significant in driving share price moves.<br><br>
        One of the few exceptions to this pattern in the portfolio was Craneware, which fell 16.2% on the election result due to concerns over the impact of potential changes to Obamacare might impact its business. However, at its AGM on the same day of the US election result, the company did reaffirm its belief in the US healthcare market’s shift towards the IT solutions which it provides. It states that its sales pipeline is giving it high levels of revenue visibility, and that a favourable market backdrop underpins its long-term growth trajectory.<br><br>
        Otherwise, company news releases were the catalyst for the portfolio’s largest movers in November.<br><br>
        For example, Clipper Logistics’ (+14.9%) trading update for the six months to October confirmed that the group remains on track to deliver an in-line performance for the year. The retail-focused logistics company highlighted that new contract wins and continued organic growth in its e-fulfilment and returns services would drive second-half performance, alongside its Click &amp; Collect joint venture with long-standing customer John Lewis, which was also formalised in November.<br><br>Redcentric (-39.4%) also issued a trading update, but unfortunately the unscheduled release was prompted by the discovery of accounting misstatements on its balance sheet. The company confirmed that significant write downs of historic profits would be likely, while the net debt position is much higher than originally reported. The board promptly removed the incumbent CFO and commenced a forensic review of the accounts, delaying the publication of its interim results to September in the meantime.<br><br>
        Better news came from Keywords Studios (+17.9%) the video game services business, which forecast early in the month that both revenues and profits for the full year are to be “significantly ahead” of current market expectations. The performance is being driven by recently acquired localisation and audio business Synthesis. Keywords Studios remains a keen consolidator within the fragmented sector and later in the month received a further boost, announcing a deal to acquire Enzyme Testing (a Canadian functional and localisation testing specialist) for CAD$5.4m, which led its house broker to boost 2017 forecasts by 5%.<br><br>
        Another strong performer was Quixant (+17%), which reported that profit will be ahead of market expectations for the year to December, thanks to increased demand from several customers for its gaming industry computer platforms.<br><br>
        Instem (-27.7%), a supplier of applications and services to the early development healthcare market, fell after news that woes in the Instem Clinical division are ongoing. Earlier in the year, growth in other divisions had been enough to compensate for the slowdown. Although this momentum continues, some contract delays now mean Instem expects numbers to come in below market expectations, though its outlook for next year remains “encouraging”.<br><br>
        Enterprise resource software provider K3 Business Technology (-12.8%) drifted having reminded the market of the importance of its upcoming busy December trading period. By contrast, Accesso (+8.8%) recovered some recent share price weakness, aided by the launch of its new “Prism” wearable device, aimed at delivering an integrated ‘smart park’ experience to customers visiting leisure park venues. The device’s functions include virtual queuing, cashless payments, messaging, photograph tagging and guest access technology.<br><br><b>

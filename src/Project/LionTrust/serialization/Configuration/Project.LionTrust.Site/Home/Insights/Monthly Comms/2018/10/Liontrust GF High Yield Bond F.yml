        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The US high yield market (ICE BofAML US High Yield Index) produced a return of 2.4% during the quarter, with lower quality parts of the market modestly outperforming. Unlike the Ryder Cup, in US dollar terms the pan-European high yield market lagged the US, but only by a matter of a few basis points. In Europe, CCCs produced a negative return though only represent a small proportion of the market. Emerging market corporates produced a return of 1.4% (ICE BofAML High Yield US Emerging Markets Liquid Corporate Plus Index) in US dollars, though certain geographies fared rather poorly.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>We believe a preference towards higher quality parts of the high yield market is an acceptable bias entrenched within our process. That being said, one of the CCCs in the Fund, Oil Company Enquest, posted good news within its first half results. In addition to production meeting management guidance, a good thing with the ramp-up of its new Kraken field, Enquest is raising equity to finance the purchase of an asset that will be instantly accretive to cash flow – excellent news for creditors. Also, Enquest is using a stake in the Kraken field’s cash flows to finance amortisation of its bank debt. A transaction which is neutral to overall debt levels, but alleviates pressure in terms of timing of debt repayment. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Other positive fundamental stories during the quarter included: the upgrading to investment grade of US gambling real estate company, Gaming and Leisure Properties; the sale of a stake in aircraft lessor Avalon to a healthy Japanese company from its financially stretched Chinese parent company; and progress on the execution of the beneficial merger between traditional regional US telecom, CenturyLink, and inner-city fibre company, Level Three. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Less positively in terms of company fundamentals, sales continue to be weak in the Victoria’s Secret business, owned by L Brands. This is despite discounting efforts by the once legendary retailer. We worry that the Victoria’s Secret brand is in decline due to factors beyond management’s reach and have exited the Fund’s holding completely. The retail sector now has zero representation in the Fund. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>During the quarter we also sold out of bonds issued by gambling company Codere. Although headquartered in Spain, Argentina represents the majority of profits and when market fears around Argentina were apparent in the wider market, but not in Codere bonds, we decided to exit the holding for the High Yield Fund, and indeed our other strategies. The sale of this bond left the Fund with zero direct or indirect exposure to the current problem countries of Argentina and Turkey. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>New additions to the Fund include: bonds issued by telecom giant Vodafone; German metering services company Techem; Latin American company Millicom (our only emerging markets holding); US casino operator MGM; packaging company BWAY; and US Mobile operator Sprint. Although valuations in high yield are on the expensive side, we are still finding interesting individual opportunities where we see good value. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>It is consensual to view default rates as remaining low in the next 12 months and we agree. It is far from profound to say they will ultimately increase from this low base. Our investment process will prepare us for this eventuality by seeking companies with the right combination of pricing power, financial flexibility and good stewardship.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>In terms of Fund positioning, we stick by our conviction that US dollar-denominated high yield bonds offer better value over the medium-to-long term than do euro-denominated bonds. Higher spreads in euro-denominated bonds are enticing, but at approximately 3.8% yield, we believe are some distance from a position of long-term fair value. At around 6.3%, US dollar bonds are much closer, in our view. If you were to hedge euro bonds into US dollar, the yield would beat US dollar bonds, but we don’t believe there is a deep enough pool of marginal buyers of euro high yield across the Atlantic to keep the market in equilibrium at a point when risk aversion in European high yield is increasing. Therefore, we continue to favour US dollar-denominated bonds which, at quarter end, represented close to 66% of the Fund. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>At quarter end the gross redemption yield on the Fund in US dollar terms was 6.2%*. It costs approximately 3.3% to hedge the Fund to a euro exposure and 1.8% into sterling. </span></p>

        Key Risks&nbsp;<br>
        </strong><br>
        Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.<br>

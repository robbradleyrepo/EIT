        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust GF Special Situations Fund returned 0.2%* in March, compared with the 1.2% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></p>
        <p>There was little evidence of any nervousness ahead of the triggering of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on 29 March. Nor was ‘risk-off’ sentiment that prevalent following President Trump’s failure to push through his much-vaunted repeal of Obamacare, which raised concerns over his ability to deliver on other fiscal reforms such as his corporate tax overhaul. UK equity markets edged up to new highs in March; the FTSE 100 closed at 7430 on 20 March and the FTSE All-Share reached 4042 on the same date.</p>
        <p>Investors appeared keen to focus on the positives, which in March included signs of a loss of momentum for far right political parties in Europe – Geert Wilders performing less strongly in Dutch elections than had been feared at one point and Marie Le Pen dropping back in French polling.&nbsp; Of greater fundamental consequence for UK investors was further robust domestic macroeconomic data. The Chancellor’s Budget included upgraded estimates of economic growth, while data from the ONS later in the month showed UK unemployment falling to 4.7% in the three months to January, as employment rose to its highest level since 1975. CPI data for February recorded a 2.3% year-on-year rise, up from January’s level and ahead of economists’ forecasts. It appears that the effect of last year’s sterling depreciation and oil price recovery is now feeding through to price levels – a factor which we believe makes it all the more vital to be invested in companies that possess pricing power, such as those we target through the Economic Advantage investment process.</p>
        <p>The oil price edged lower on the month as US inventory data exceeded expectations, while Opec raised its forecast for non-Opec supply – limiting the extent to which the cartel’s actions can boost prices. Brent crude slid 6% to $52.8 a barrel over the month. </p>
        <p>The energy industry downturn was a factor in Wood Group (+0.7%), a holding within the Fund, announcing an agreed deal to acquire Amec Foster Wheeler for 0.75 new shares in Wood Group. As providers of engineering and other support services to the oil &amp; gas industry, both companies have experienced top-line pressure as a result of the slow-down and see consolidation as a logical route to cost control. At the time of the announcement, Wood Group stated that it had already identified £110m in cost synergies, an estimate it has since upgraded.</p>
        <p>Plexus Holdings (-17.6%) is another portfolio position to have been affected by lower activity levels in the energy industry. Last month it issued a profit warning stating that trading was materially behind expectations as an extended period of low oil prices fed through to reduced levels of exploration, particularly in the North Sea. Its shares lost further ground ahead of the 30 March release of interim results which quantified the impact of the downturn: sales fell from £6.8m a year earlier to £3.8m. The company reiterated its view – also given within the trading update – that the bottom of the cycle has now been reached, underpinning more positive outlook comments for the oil &amp; gas drilling activity.<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>It was a busy month for corporate earnings releases as a range of companies reported for the period to 31 December 2016. Mobile payments provider Bango (+43.9%) saw the strongest share price reaction to full year results. Its release revealed that end user spend (EUS) had reached £132m, almost three times higher than the previous year. Its market is growing rapidly, as illustrated by the fact that annualised EUS finished the year running at a rate of £195m. The margin Bango takes from this revenue stayed stable at 1.8%, allowing it to report a doubling of revenue to £2.6m. These figures were in-line with expectations having already been flagged within January’s trading statement, but the shares nevertheless made further gains on the back of the announcement. The company’s outlook comments were upbeat, outlining an expectation that EUS will at least double in 2017.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Domino’s Pizza Group (-18.5%) shares showed the most evidence of investor disappointment; the release of FY2016 results triggered an almost 20% share price drop from the month’s starting level near all-time highs. Rather than any particularly nasty surprises hidden within its results, the catalyst for the slide was instead a reassessment of the price that should be paid for the shares given some evidence of slowing growth. UK like-for-like system sales grew 7.5% during 2016, down from 11.7% the prior year. Total sales including 81 new stores were up 14.5% to just over £1bn. This growth fed through to a very healthy 17% expansion in profit before tax. However, in the first nine weeks of the new fiscal year, UK like-for-like sales growth has slowed to 1.5%. We believe there is still plenty of further growth in Domino’s Pizza’s business model and expect it to continue to be a strong long-term compounder of earnings. The results triggered some marginal downgrades to consensus EPS expectations for 2017 and 2018, but the share price fall looks to have more than priced this in. The shares now trade on around 20x prospective earnings net of downgrades. </p>
        <p>Aggreko’s (-16.2%) results also triggered a weakening of its share price due to the inclusion of a warning on 2017 profit. Having announced a 12% fall in adjusted profit before tax, the equipment rental and temporary power provider stated that the impact of recent forced discounts to legacy contracts in Argentina will be significant, wiping out planned cost savings this year and leading to a further reduction in profit before tax.</p>
        <p>Testing and quality assurance specialist Intertek (+11.5%) grew its revenues by 9% in constant currency terms in 2016, with sterling weakness boosting reported growth to 18.5%. The company expects 2017 to see another solid increase in organic revenues, which should be supplemented by “moderate” expansion in profit margins.&nbsp; The company raised its dividend by 19% after seeing free cash flow generation rise 35% to represent a cash conversion ratio of 139%.</p>
        <p>Spirax-Sarco Engineering (+7.2%) was another to receive a currency boost, with reported sales growth of 14% exceeding organic growth of 4%. Against a background of subdued growth in global industrial production, Spirax-Sarco Engineering expects sales of its products for steam systems to grow organically in single-digit terms while margins are maintained at record levels. The company also highlighted the business visibility provided by the 85% of revenues which are generated from customers’ maintenance and operational budgets. A high degree of recurring revenues is one of the core intangible assets which the Economic Advantage investment process seeks to identify.</p>
        <p>Savills (+7.6%) defied signs of slowdown in the UK property market in full year results which showed the benefits of its international reach, high-end focus and non-transactional revenue streams. Underlying profits grew 12% to £136m on the back of 13% revenue growth. Asia and Continental European markets drove 7% revenue growth in its Transaction Advisory business while the smaller Property Management and Consultancy divisions saw 21% and 4% increases. </p>
        <p>Fund administrator Sanne Group (+6.4%) released 2016 results which gave more detail on the positive trends highlighted within its January trading update. During the year, the company secured new business with a total projected annualised value of £13.8m. Group revenue rose by 40% to £63.8m, while underlying profit before tax grew by 37% to £22m. While referencing the ongoing market uncertainty resulting from geopolitical events, the company states that it feels well placed to deliver strong growth. </p>

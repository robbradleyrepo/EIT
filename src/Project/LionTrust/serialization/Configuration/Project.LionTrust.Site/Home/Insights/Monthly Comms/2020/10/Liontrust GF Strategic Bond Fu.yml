        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust GF Strategic Bond Fund returned -0.4%* in US dollar terms in September. </span></strong><span><strong><span>The average return from the EAA Fund Global Flexible Bond (Morningstar) sector, the Fund’s reference sector, was -0.3%.</span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Market backdrop</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Global economic recovery has advanced well compared with what had been expected earlier this year. We have a long road to recovery; a road that is winding and bumpy thanks to a combination of politics and Covid-19. </span><a href="https://www.liontrust.co.uk/what-we-think/blogs/quarterly-strategy-how-we-are-preparing-for-the-covid-19-recovery"><span style="color: #34b233;">Our recent strategy piece</span></a><span> continues to be relevant in that respect. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Investors had worries aplenty as the quarter drew to a close: equity valuations looked challenging, corporate bond supply increased, and concerns grew that further US fiscal stimulus would be delayed until after the US election. Overall, risk assets had their poorest month since March.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We mentioned the change of strategy outlined by the Federal Reserve – to move to a symmetrical inflation target. As expected, that has had some implication for bond markets. The US bond market in particular has fallen in value and to a greater extent than international peers. Specifically, long-dated US bonds fell in value. Investors remain certain that a further US fiscal stimulus package will materialise and fear the Fed may be successful hitting its inflation target.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We have long held US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). This has provided the portfolio with a degree of protection in recent days. Also, we switched from 10-year TIPS into their 30-year equivalent.</span></p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Mean Reversion, Curve Plays &amp; Portfolio Construction</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We thought it worth a few words on interest rate curves and how we have been playing them. First off, we don’t like government bonds. Since launch, our portfolio has had less than half the interest rate risk of the global bond market. Between central banks, QE and investors seeking safe havens, government bonds have performed very well in recent years.</span></p>
        <p><span><br />
        We do have a number of levers we can pull to try to make money, and not just the big one of market direction. Two of those levers have been inflation-linked securities (the TIPS mentioned above) and interest rate curves. We can use these levers to construct a portfolio that can do OK, even if our overall beta – our directional exposure – is less than that of others. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Generally speaking, long-dated bonds do better when bond markets are rallying. We’d term that a bull flattening – where all yields fall, but longer ones fall more than short ones. TIPs and similar securities tend to move in the opposite direction: bonds rally as inflation expectations fall so instruments like TIPs are in less demand.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">What have we done recently? Firstly, we owned a reasonable amount of long-dated US bonds and not much in shorter dates. This gave us some protection: if we were wrong and bond markets rallied, then we’d get a better pay off owning those long bonds than the short ones.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Second, we switched our 10-year TIPs into longer dates, expecting mean reversion. 10-year TIPs had gapped higher since March and the extra inflation compensation to 30-year TIPs declined to zero, back to pre-crisis levels. But we believed Powell’s new inflation mantra boosted the attractiveness of those very long-dated TIPS and, at the same time, reduced the attractiveness of all US bonds, especially long-dated ones (i.e. a bear steepener).</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="-/media/EC3854DCD57F4CDCABD0056F4E404B2C.ashx?h=314&amp;w=600" style="width:600px; height:314px;" alt="US treasury inflation" class="custom-image-height-auto" /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">As you can see, the spread between 10-year and 30-year TIPs has widened again. So, although we do continue to own some long-dated US Treasuries, the holding is in 30-year TIPs, which have rallied relative to conventional Treasuries and their 10-year equivalent. This might all sound a bit complicated. In reality, it’s nothing more than mean reversion/value process helping construct a portfolio.</span></p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Rates</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">There really isn’t much change from last month and we retain the same overall shape. We do think long-dated bonds are vulnerable, hence the switch into TIPS. We should also note that all the fund duration in bonds over 10 years is either in corporate credit or in TIPS. We have no direct exposure to any government bond of longer than 10 years maturity. At the end of August, the Fund had 3 years’ duration</span><sup>†</sup><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">, with a strong preference for the US.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We remained modestly negative UK duration and modestly positive Europe (via investment grade bonds linked to Bunds) for two reasons:</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li><span>We expect some form of Brexit deal to be done. Gilts are vulnerable under that scenario but are arguably even more vulnerable in the medium term if the UK budget deficit balloons and the country loses the protection of big brother Europe.</span></li>
            <li><span>European rates are way too low. However, the prospect of any change to monetary policy is remote. So, although we hate doing it, owning some risk relative to the UK is a sensible hedge.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Allocation</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We remained a little overweight credit – remember our neutral weights are around 50% investment grade and 20% high yield. At</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> month end we were around 55% investment grade and 27% high yield. We had been lower, but equity market weakness (delay to fiscal stimulus, US politics and concerns the Nasdaq had flown too near the sun) spilled into high yield derivatives. That gave us the opportunity to add a little at levels not seen since early in the second quarter. The widening of credit spreads combined with becalmed sovereign yields to take portfolio returns modestly negative on the month.</span></p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Selection</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We added a couple of investment grade “green” bonds to the portfolio as supply increased post the holiday season. We use MSCI as the external provider for our ESG scoring and target a portfolio average ESG rating of at least BBB. Green bonds aren’t really much cheaper than conventional ones any longer. However, demand for them has increased significantly so we are much less worried about secondary liquidity than we were a couple of years ago.</span></p>

Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bought – LG Chem.</strong> The Korean petrochemical company is vertically integrated from naphtha (as a feedstock) to everyday household goods and horizontally diversified across industrial materials, fine and specialty chemicals and batteries. In 2016 it also purchased a life sciences business.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Petrochemicals still accounts for more than two thirds of sales and all of current operating profit. Its other businesses are likely to improve, however, with the biggest potential coming from the battery division and increasing demand from electric vehicles.</p>
        <p>A target price of KRW340,000 for the ordinary shares is based on 1.4x book value, which is 1 standard deviation below mid-cycle price/book of 1.9x. We believe this is fair given the company’s diversification into non-petrochemical sectors, which has resulted in a lower return on equity, and which are currently being valued at zero. The Fund is invested in the preference shares, for which we have a target price of KRW222,000 – retaining the current 35% discount to the ordinary shares, clearly leaving room for upside while providing a yield of 2.8%.</p><p><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Disclaimer:<o:p></o:p></b></p><p class="MsoNormal">• Past performance is not a guide to future performance. •

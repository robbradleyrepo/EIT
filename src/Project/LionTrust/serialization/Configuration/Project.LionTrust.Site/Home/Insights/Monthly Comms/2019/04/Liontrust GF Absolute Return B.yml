        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>2019 has started off strongly for nearly all asset classes. Credit risk recovered strongly from its oversold position in late December, helped initially by stronger employment data in the US in early January. Global growth concerns have remained at elevated levels and this has had large ramifications for monetary policy. The US Federal Reserve now no longer expects to raise interest rates this year having previously anticipated two rate rises. Where the Fed leads many other central bankers follow and a more dovish rates outlook has arisen, inter alia, in the euro zone, Australia and Canada.&nbsp; This has helped to rekindle the notion of the “put” for risk markets where the central bank reaction function will come to the rescue in any sticky situation.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Carry Component</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br>We maintain our strong preference for US dollar-denominated carry in the Fund but will be looking to rotate within this into more floating rate notes (FRNs) in the US as the short end of the Treasury curve has inverted; 2 to 5 year maturity US Treasuries now yield less than the effective Fed Funds Rate. Bonds issued by <strong>McKesson</strong> matured during the quarter and new purchases included <strong>AMP</strong>, the Australian money manager and <strong>CJ Rail</strong>, operator of the bullet train in Japan.&nbsp; As the Fund grows we will continue to actively increase the diversity within the carry component.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Alpha Sources</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span><br>(i) Rates</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Through the cycle the Fund has a duration range mid-point of 1.5 years. The majority of the first quarter was spent slightly below that as the rally in government bonds has taken yields to very expensive levels. Towards the end of March overall Fund adjusted underlying duration was reduced to just under 1 year</span><sup><span>† </span></sup><span>to protect capital in any rates correction.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We instigated a long 10 year / short 30 year US curve steepener, a position that has a net neutral duration contribution. The 30 year part of the curve is more vulnerable to the Fed running with inflation above their 2% target for a while and potentially letting the inflationary genie out of the bottle. The Fund closed out its short Canada / long US government bond futures position as it approached our strict stop loss limit of 10 basis points contribution.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>(ii) Allocation</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>As discussed in the Fund’s Q4 report, the Fund started the year long high yield versus an offsetting short in emerging markets, both legs using liquid credit default swap indices with sizes adjusted to account for different betas. This position made a profit which was crystallised during February.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>(iii) Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Selection was strong during the first quarter of 2019.&nbsp; The largest contributors were <strong>Rabobank</strong>, <strong>Reynolds</strong> <strong>and JP Morgan</strong> FRNs. The former two were sold, with the disposal of Reynolds leaving the Fund with no high yield weighting. Rabobank bonds were replaced with a special situation bond from <strong>RBS</strong>; this is issued out of its NV entity which has excess capital due to be released in the next few quarters, hopefully leading to a bond tender.&nbsp; Credit spreads on bonds issued by <strong>Sky</strong> had not yet converged with its new more highly rated parent Comcast, so we established a new position in Sky. Comcast has now offered parent company guarantees to subsume Sky and the bonds duly rallied, so we then took profits.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><sup><span><br>† </span></sup><em><span>Adjusted underlying duration is based on the correlation of the instruments as opposed to just the mathematical weighted average of cash flows.&nbsp; High yield companies' bonds exhibit less duration sensitivity as the credit risk has a bigger proportion of the total yield; the lower the credit quality the less rate-sensitive the bond.&nbsp; Additionally, some subordinated financials also have low duration correlations and the bonds trade on a cash price rather than spread.&nbsp;</span></em></p>

        <strong>Key Risks</strong><strong><br>
        <br>
        </strong>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.<br>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust GF Absolute Return Bond Fund (C5 share class) returned 5.3%* in sterling terms in Q2 2020 and the IA Targeted Absolute Return, the Fund’s reference sector, returned 4.2%. The Fund’s primary US dollar share class (B5) returned 5.4%.</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>April’s return of 3.5% (B5) represented the largest part of the Fund’s quarterly gain as credit markets reacted to monetary stimulus, rebounding from their vastly oversold position in March. In the previous quarterly report we stated that “<em>The credit spread widening exhibited by the Fund’s Carry Component holdings, as well as those in Selection, should see a meaningful retracement over the next few months and we are confident that the rolling 1-year absolute return will soon be positive again</em>.” As it transpires, the rolling 1-year return was negative for less than a month and a new total return high was reached just over two months after the trough in March.&nbsp; Market volatility has fallen dramatically from the peak in March and April; a commensurate reduction in the Fund’s volatility of returns has naturally followed this and those months have proven to truly be the exceptions for this Fund, which aims to be comparatively low risk.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Market backdrop</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The speed and extent of the recovery are determined by how deeply scarred economies are by the crisis and lockdown. In the US, where there was not a government-sponsored furlough scheme, there was a huge jump in unemployment. As can be seen from the chart below, this has started to reverse with 78% of jobs lost being viewed as temporary layoffs. 7.5 million jobs have been recovered in the US so far, but momentum is presently slowing due to the risk of a second wave of the virus.<br /></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br /></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><img src="-/media/2A1BBCD8C3C248CE84B2128A32A60354.ashx?h=314&amp;w=600" style="width:600px; height:314px;" alt="US Unemployment" class="custom-image-height-auto" /></span></p>
        <p><span>Many southern US states have now had to pause or even reverse the easing of restrictions; personally, I would argue that this is not a second wave per se, but rather the failure to deal properly with the first wave of infections. Worldwide, one has to expect more localised flare ups but hopefully these will remain well contained.</span></p>
        <p><span>We continue to emphasise that the recovery will not be V-shaped in nature; it is sharp simply because of the extent of the downturn, but the right-hand side of the V will not reach as high. It will not be until the end of 2021, or 6-12 months after a vaccine, that real GDP is likely to reach levels on a par with the end of 2019. Some companies’ top lines will be fine this year but very few will avoid margin pressure due to alternative working practices. We think that dividends will continue to be cut and share buybacks suspended as balance sheet strength and servicing debt – paying mandatory coupons – is prioritised.</span></p>
        <p><span>The one certainty we do have for the foreseeable future is loose monetary policy. Central bankers have been clear that they will be more tolerant of inflation, running economies “hot” for a while, in order to try to heal the economic scars of the crisis. The Federal Reserve’s dot plot of members’ rates expectations shows a holding pattern until at least the end of 2022. Over the next few months expect further forward guidance from the Fed and probably implicit yield curve control rather than the more explicit yield targeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Credit curve inversion revisited</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>We discussed last quarter that as well as record levels of credit spread widening during the crisis, we also saw credit curve inversion: shorter dated bonds at one stage had wider spreads than their longer dated cousins. The reason for this was the sheer extent of forced selling by both active corporate bond funds and ETFs (exchange traded funds). The US Federal Reserve through the initial promise of the SMCCF (Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility), then actual delivery of the program, caused a massive change in market sentiment. Market-wide outflows rapidly reversed, and the credit market started functioning normally again. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="-/media/EE2224ACB67B4FE8BD68F56CF4560731.ashx?h=314&amp;w=600" style="width:600px; height:314px;" alt="Crisis credit curve inversion" class="custom-image-height-auto" /></p>
        <p><span>The chart above shows the credit curve at the start of 2020, the date that the Federal Reserve announced their emergency policies (March 23<sup>rd</sup>) and the end of the first half. It is clear that investment grade spreads have retraced a large portion of their widening and the credit curve is back to having a gentle upward sloping shape, rationally reflecting increased risks over time. Even with spreads now about 50 basis points wider than where they started the year the Fund is up 1.9% (B5) for the half year, showing the benefit of effectively managing through the crisis and generating alpha.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Carry Component</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We split the Fund into the Carry Component and three Alpha Sources for clarity in reporting, but it is worth emphasising we manage the Fund’s positioning and risk in its entirety. As a reminder, the Carry Component invests in investment grade bonds with &lt;5 years to maturity, this is exactly the type of bond the Fed’s SMCCF program is buying.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The bounce back in the holdings in the Carry Component was the largest driver of the strong performance during the quarter. This is the beta part of the Fund that normally provides a low volatility source of yield; the extreme moves in March and April should prove to be an aberration. There is a natural pull to par for these short-dated, high-quality issuers; so, for example, buying more of a 2023 maturity AstraZeneca bond at 92c in the dollar was in our view a low risk way of boosting the Fund’s return.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The Fund has been gradually rotating out of floating rate notes (FRNs) within the Carry Component as many of the bonds recovered strongly and have become fully valued; those with credit spreads of less than 50 basis points are being sold and rotated into conventional fixed-coupon bonds. Examples include selling a <strong>CVS</strong> FRN to buy a new issue from a Pfizer spinoff division <strong>Upjohn</strong>.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Alpha Sources:</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Rates</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>The Fund made money twice during the quarter from inflation breakeven positions in the US; the market’s inflation expectations had fallen too far creating a great valuation opportunity. We captured this by buying Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and selling the Treasury bond future, thus having a duration-neutral position. The US Federal Reserve has started buying TIPS and we took advantage of the squeeze this created to lock in profits on the first position before re-entering the trade again at a lower level; this was also profitably closed out during the quarter. </span></p>
        <p><span>A new rates position was established in June: long Swedish 6-year maturity debt versus short Germany at the 5-year tenor using the BOBL future. Sweden had underperformed other rates markets due to the experiment with no full Covid19 lockdown – the economy dipped less but we think ongoing cases mean it will take longer for the recovery in activity to happen. Further quantitative easing from the Swedish Riksbank was announced at the end of June; this was mildly supportive for the position as some central bank easing had been widely anticipated.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Allocation</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>The Fund made money out of being long risk CDX IG, the US investment grade CDS index, versus short risk the iTraxx Europe Credit Default Swap index (this index is often referred to as “Main”). Profits were taken, then the Fund entered back into the position when the differential between CDX IG and main reached 10 basis points again.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>Selection was very strong during the quarter. Highlights include <strong>Danaher</strong> and <strong>Eli Lilly;</strong> the latter was trimmed at pretty much its tightest spread since the bond was issued. Within the small allocation to high-quality high yield in the Fund, <strong>Allfunds’</strong> bonds also bounced strongly.</span></p>
        <p><span>Positions in two large defensive US financials, <strong>State Street </strong>and <strong>AIG</strong>, were purchased during the crisis at attractive levels; these have rallied strongly but still offer further upside without pricing needing to get anywhere near their previous credit spread tights.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p><span>It is also worth mentioning some of the stronger stock contributors from the Carry Component. Bonds in <strong>Welltower</strong>, a US healthcare REIT, rebounded strongly; as did those of <strong>Verizon</strong>. The Fund increased its weighting in <strong>Dell</strong> during the crisis and has since banked the profit on the addition. Finally, a holding in <strong>AMT</strong>, a mobile towers business, was bought for carry at wide levels and has performed strongly too.</span></p>

Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

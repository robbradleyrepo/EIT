        <p><strong><span style="color: black;">As more of us adapt our behaviour with climate change in mind, most activity has understandably been around how we heat and power our homes and travel around the world. But it is becoming increasingly clear that we also need to take a hard look at how we communicate and consume media.</span></strong></p>
        <p><em><span style="color: black;">Connecting people</span></em><span style="color: black;"> is one of our 20 investment themes as we believe access to communication tools and information, increasing amounts of which are online, is a pre-requisite of a more sustainable economy.</span><span style="color: black;"> The exponential rise in data and the need for connection between network carriers, enterprises and end users is driving ever-evolving infrastructure and growth in this area.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">But</span><span style="color: black;"> as the digital world comes to encompass every conceivable field of human endeavour, we also have to be conscious of the potential environmental impact.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: black;"><img src="-/media/A9D83B02FC7441A2AC4DC54B534AC816.ashx?h=335&amp;w=601" style="width:601px; height:335px;" alt="Distribution of energy for the production and use of digital services" class="custom-image-height-auto" /></span></p>
        <p style="margin: 18pt 0cm 10pt 1.4pt;"><span style="color: black;">Source:<span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;"> </span><em>The<span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;"> </span>Shift<span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;"> </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Project</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;"> </span></em>2018,<span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;"> </span>as<span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;"> </span>of<span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;"> </span>Andrae<span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;"> </span>&amp; Edler<span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;"> </span>2015</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">New figures from think tank The Shift Project reveal that digital technologies now account for 4% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which is more than civil aviation, and this could double by 2025 as the energy required is increasing 9% a year. A few other figures highlight the scale of our global digital footprint:</span></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span style="color: black;">Online videos globally emit as much C02 as Spain (over 300 million tonnes per year).</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: black;">Online video services (like Netflix) account for 60% of global data flows and the GHG emissions of video-on-demand services like Netflix and Amazon Prime are equivalent to those of a country like Chile (more than 100 million tonnes per year). </span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="color: black;">According to The Shift Project, as people cannot see the pollution from selfies and videos streams, there is a perception these services are boundless; in reality, however, they suggest we need to move towards greater &lsquo;data sobriety&rsquo; and the fear is that this means greater regulation.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">New research shows the impact even a small change in online behavior can have, with data from </span><span style="color: black;">OVO Energy claiming that sending just one less unnecessary email a day would save more than 16,000 tonnes of carbon a year, the equivalent of taking 3,300 diesel cars off the road. According to the report, excessive emailing</span><span style="color: black;"> contributes </span><span style="color: black;">23,475 tonnes of carbon a year to the UK's footprint.</span></p>
        <p class="mol-para-with-font" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: black;">This issue of rising data usage, and the amount of energy it requires, is one we have been tracking for several years. Traditionally, companies tended to have on-site server rooms, often in regular offices, and while </span><span>these have evolved over time, they were not purpose built so cooling and ancillary power requirements make them highly inefficient.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="mol-para-with-font" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span>Therefore, we see considerable <span style="color: black;">resource benefits coming from the trend towards outsourced storage and processing, </span>focusing on data centre operators that have low power usage effectiveness (PUE) and also use electricity from renewable sources.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">We believe these co-location centres are vital for the digital economy and will increasingly underpin the infrastructure necessary for a more sustainable world. However, electricity used by data centres is expected to double approximately every five years and their emissions are already comparable to small countries. Energy now represents around two-thirds of the total data centre cost, greater than the hardware within them, mainly consumed by the ancillary systems such as cooling and Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPS).</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Investing in companies that are finding solutions to the world&rsquo;s problems is central to our investment process and we believe those enabling significant energy and carbon dioxide savings for these centres should benefit from a sustained increase in demand. The technology industry in the US now emits more carbon than ever before, so more efficient data centres are vital: for the centres themselves, power is their biggest cost, giving further incentives to design and run their centres more efficiently.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">We look at the world through the lens of 20 sustainable themes and companies in the data centre space represent a rare confluence of two of these, namely <em>Connecting people</em> and <em>Improving the efficiency of energy use. </em></span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Held in our funds since 2011, US company Equinix runs co-location data centres, providing a gateway into important digital infrastructure such as public cloud computing networks. Equinix stands out as the only genuinely global player in this market and its centres have become an integral part of the plumbing for the digital economy. Its assets are almost impossible to copy, creating an important competitive advantage. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">On top of this, the business is addressing critical environmental impacts of the technology industry. It discloses climate change impacts and mitigation efforts in a Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) submission for example, and while no science-based targets are set so far the company anticipates doing this in the next two years.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Equinix has a long-term goal to reach 100% renewable energy, and in 2018 91% of purchased electricity came from renewable sources.&nbsp;The company also has a Global Energy Efficiency Program and completed 42 projects in 2018, upgrading and retrofitting chillers, control systems and a power supply.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">We also hold InterXion across our European funds, a provider of carrier and cloud neutral co-location data centre services in Europe, supporting 1,800 customers through 50 data centres in 11 countries. While the company lags global peers on social and environmental reporting, it has good programmes in place operationally and runs all its centres on renewable energy. We continue to engage with the business on how its energy efficiency programmes work and encourage the company to report to the CDP.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">Digital technologies and the internet have fundamentally changed the way many of us conduct our lives and Moore&rsquo;s law on the rate of technical advance suggests far greater transitions to come. Providing broader access to this trend must be part of any sustainable world but it is vitally important, to paraphrase the UN&rsquo;s 1987 Brundtland Report, that we are not compromising the future by meeting the needs of the present.</span></p>

        </strong><br />
        Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The majority of the Liontrust Sustainable Future Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Some of these funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well-regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and has a concentrated portfolio of securities, there is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund&rsquo;s share price. Liontrust SF Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Corporate Bond Fund, Liontrust SF Cautious Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Defensive Managed Fund and Liontrust Monthly Income Bond Fund invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions, it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the bonds held by these funds. Mentioned above five funds can also invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interests rates move or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions.<br />

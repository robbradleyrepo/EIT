        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned -0.1%* in November, compared with the -1.8% return from the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index.</strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">UK equity weakness was broad this month as the market digested a host of company trading updates though the small cap side of the market fared better than large and mid caps. The Fund outperformed the FTSE Small Cap (ex IT) with <strong>AB Dynamics </strong>(+29.0%) delivering a stand out performance amongst the Fund&rsquo;s holdings as its share price surged ahead of, and after, the release of its full-year results. The company, which designs, manufactures and supplies </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">advanced testing systems and measurement products to the global automotive industry, reported a 20% increase in revenue and 26% improvement in adjusted operating profit, benefiting from higher customer expenditure for advanced test and measurement equipment. Its outlook was also reassuring, with an order book at record levels and visibility into the third quarter of the new financial year.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Tracsis </strong></span><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(+16.9%) was another company to report a higher revenue and profit for its full-year. Against tough comparators in 2016, the group managed to deliver a 6% increase in revenue, while pre-tax profit rose 14%. Trading was aided by the integration of Ontrac and SEP which were acquired by Tracsis in 2015/2016.</span></p>
        <p><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Cloud communications software provider </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">IMImobile </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(+17.4%) recorded a 48% annual increase in revenue for the six months ending in September and a 3% rise in pre-tax profit. The group&rsquo;s operations in India and South East Asia made significant progress, with gross profit growing by 84% in the six month period. The company had earlier in the month stated that it expects underlying and gross profit for the full-year to come ahead of market expectations and announced the acquisition of US-based communications platform provider Sumotext for between US$4.5m and US$6.0m.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">On the other side of the spectrum,</span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> Empresaria Group </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(-19.3%) warned that adjusted pre-tax profit for its full year is expected to be below current market expectations. This was a consequence of squeezed margins in its German business, which should impact profit through 2018 as well. In addition to this, weakness in Middle Eastern markets resulted in higher costs.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Away from corporate earnings, defence mini-conglomerate </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Cohort </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(-23.2%)</span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">fell on read-across concerns about UK defence spending after peer Ultra Electronics issued a profit warning highlighting funding issues to defence programmes. However, Cohort issued a statement towards the end of the month confirming that it remains on course to meet the board&rsquo;s expectations for the full-year, which provided some support to its share price.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Lighting equipment manufacturer </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">FW Thorpe&rsquo;s</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> (-16.1%) share price declined throughout the month. The company stated in a short AGM statement that the second half of its financial year is difficult to predict, though management remain confident that the company is well placed to deal with any external headwinds.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Ideagen </strong></span><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(+24.8%) shot higher after announcing a contract win worth an initial US$1.6m with a &ldquo;global leader in the petrochemical industry&rdquo;. The company, which supplies compliance-based information management software, stated that US$1.1m of the initial payment is expected to be received in the current year. </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Bango </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(+13.1%) announced two new deals. The mobile payments company expanded its direct carrier billing services to Amazon Prime customers in Japan. It also launched operator-billed payments for Google Play users with 9mobile in Nigeria.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Quixant </strong></span><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(-11.0%) and <strong>Keywords Studios </strong>(-8.1%) </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">both experienced some profit taking in November after displaying sustained share price strength in the year to date. Keywords&rsquo; share price weakness came despite a capital markets day event during the month, at which the company delivered a positive message to investors of continued growth opportunities in its video gaming services outsourcing business</span><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">.</span></p>

The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</span></p>

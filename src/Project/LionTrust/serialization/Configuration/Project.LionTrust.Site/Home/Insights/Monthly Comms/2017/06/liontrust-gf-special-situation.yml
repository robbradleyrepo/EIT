        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Liontrust GF Special Situations Fund C1 and C3 accumulation classes both returned 3.6%* in May compared with the 4.4% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">London-listed stocks continued their strong run in May, with the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 both notching new all-time highs. However, it was the large cap index which outperformed (+4.9% vs +2.2%). Developments ahead of the UK General Election contributed to the sterling weakness (-2.8% in trade weighted terms) and large-cap outperformance as opinion polls showed Theresa May’s lead over Jeremy Corbyn narrowing throughout the month. The FTSE Small Cap and AIM All-Share indices returned 2.6% and 3.1% respectively. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Fund’s underweight position in large caps relative to the FTSE All-Share Index was therefore a headwind in May. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Defensive areas of the FTSE All-Share led the gains with telecoms (+10.6%), utilities (+7.9%) and health care (+7.8%) the best sector performers. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Fund’s exposure to this trend was limited by its underweight positions in telecoms and utilities but it did benefit via its health care exposure as both AstraZeneca (+12.9%) and GlaxoSmithKline (+11.2%) recorded strong gains. Having both featured in the Fund’s negative contributors after the release of Q1 numbers last month, shares in both companies came strongly back into favour. AstraZeneca’s rally was aided by good news relating to trials on its <em>Imfinzi </em>drug. The treatment was found to be statistically significant and clinically meaningful in improving progression-free survival when used by lung cancer patients for whom surgery is not an option.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Both of the Fund’s large-cap household goods stocks – Reckitt Benckiser (+11.6%) and Unilever (+9.9%) – were also among May’s top contributors with their steady growth profiles seeing them benefit from the investor rotation into defensives. The two companies are reviewing their portfolio of brands, looking for opportunities to make value enhancing deals. Unilever’s strategic review concluded that its Spreads business would be sold, but it has sought to accelerate growth in its core Foods &amp; Refreshment division – buying Colombia’s Quala and launching a joint venture in Myanmar. Reckitt Benckiser in April announced that its French’s Food business was for sale, as it looked to reshuffle its portfolio ahead of completion of the US$18bn acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Wilmington (+13.4%) was another strong portfolio performer in May. In a trading statement for the nine months to the end of March, the information, education and networking services provider reported a 13% rise in revenue, in line with its expectations. The company added that it is on track to meet its Board’s expectations for the full-year. While we still hold a positive assessment of Wilmington’s Economic Advantage characteristics, one of our investment processes rules is that all small companies must have at least 3% Board equity ownership to ensure alignment of incentives. Wilmington slipped below this level, leading us to initiate a managed exit from the position, a process which was completed in May.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares in RWS Holdings (+12.4%) have been rerated since an early April trading statement which announced 37% year-on-year growth in adjusted interim profit before tax, following strong growth in patent translation demand particularly for its higher margin subscription based services.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Oil and gas related stocks were a downside feature in May. The Fund’s exploration and production majors held up well (BP +7.3%; Royal Dutch Shell +5.9%) despite a slight softening of the spot crude market, but Wood Group (-5.8%) and Weir Group (-8.8%) weakened. The FTSE 350 Oil Equipment Services &amp; Distribution Index returned -19.2% in May, dragged down by Petrofac after the Serious Fraud Office opened an investigation into dealings in Kazakhstan via Unaoil, a Monaco-based consultancy. Concerns that the fallout could widen led to some spillover to the shares of sector peers.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">PayPoint (-7.0%) released full year results that painted a picture of a company in transition. Net revenues were flat year-on-year at £124m, but stripping out the impact of non-core businesses sold (Online &amp; Mobile) its retail net revenue grew 6% to £118m. PayPoint provides a payments and parcel delivery network operating from over 40,000 convenience stores. Following its refocus, it is looking to develop a new payment service offering which will compensate for an anticipated decline in customers using cash to pay utility bills over the counter. </p>

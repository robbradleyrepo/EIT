        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned 4.2%* in February. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index returned 0.9%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned 2.8% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was 2.2%.</strong></p>
        <p>The Fund’s best performing holdings in February included a mix of those re-rating without any obvious catalyst (including Jaywing (+28.4%) and CML Microsystems (+22.6%)) and those responding to significant company newsflow. In the latter category sits Animalcare (+19.5%), the veterinary medicine supplier which released interim results that were ahead of expectations. This strength was driven primarily by the group’s largest division, Licensed Veterinary Medicines, which grew by over 17% on a like for like basis. The division saw healthy demand for existing medicines from both domestic and export markets, and also benefitted from the launch of four new products during the period.</p>
        <p>Quartix (+32.1%), which supplies vehicle telematics and services, has recently refocused its sales efforts towards its fleet business and away from its insurance division. Some investors were initially unsure about this change of emphasis and its share price softened following its January trading update, which we covered in last month’s Fund review. However, long term investors who have been willing to stick with the company are now being rewarded for their patience. There is a growing appreciation of the benefits of a focus on high quality recurring fleet revenue growth rather than low margin, low visibility business on the insurance side. Full year results released in February revealed a 19% rise in revenues to £23.3m as good growth in the second half of its fiscal year led to a 16% increase in its customer base (to 9,105) and a 19% rise in subscription units (to 87,889).</p>
        <p>An interim trading update from Tracsis (-28.4%) indicated that activity will be significantly skewed to the second half of its year and also subject to the “timely conversion of new sales” for the group’s software products and services. As ever, the market was unimpressed by the increased uncertainty and investors responded by increasing the risk discount applied to the shares. The Economic Advantage characteristics first identified in the stock (Intellectual Property and Distribution Network strengths) remain intact; however, the unexpected setback serves as a reminder of why the Fund also prizes the visibility of high contracted recurring revenues over lumpier licence sales.</p>
        <p>Hayward Tyler Group (-40.4%) suffered a sharper setback in fortunes during the month, illustrating the perils of stretching the balance sheet for a small company with sporadic order flow. In February, there were initially positive signs as the company gave an upbeat update on order intake early in the month. But just a few weeks later the group said it had seen delays in securing some of the contracts required to meet its full year targets and that it was in discussions with its bank regarding the repayment schedule on its short-term borrowing facilities. Later in the month, it announced a one month extension to a £2.4m repayment which was initially due at the end of February. The Fund’s exposure to this disappointing news and sharp share price adjustment was relatively limited, for two reasons. Firstly, the company had initially received a high risk score for its level of financial gearing, meaning that it was included in the portfolio with a low target weight of 1.0%. Secondly, the Fund had already significantly reduced its position at the time of the company’s interim results release in November, feeling that full year forecasts were considerably over-ambitious. The remaining small position in the Fund is now under review while the company’s balance sheet position remains so tenuous.</p>
        <p>Among other portfolio developments, Cello Group (+20.7%) announced the acquisition of Defined Health, a US-based strategic consulting firm focused on development-stage biotech and healthcare businesses. Defined Health will help the company to boost its presence in the all-important North American healthcare market. Its focus on earlier-stage biotech clients complements Cello’s existing strengths in advising companies further down the road to commercialisation of drug prospects. The deal will be partly financed by a £15m placing which was significantly oversubscribed. While the size of the raise dilutes earnings in the short term, it diversifies the group’s shareholder base with the addition of a number of supportive long term investors to the register.</p>
        <p>Marlowe (-13.2%) also continued on the acquisition trail, buying two fire protection businesses for a combined total of £4.6m, net of cash acquired. However, the shares – having rallied intensely since an equity placing in December last year – gave up some ground.&nbsp; Sepura (-27.6%) remains in bid situation as the recommended cash offer from Hytera Communication continues to make its way through the lengthy competition approval process. The announcement that the German competition authorities would launch a Phase II investigation into the takeover heralded a fresh bout of uncertainty over the likelihood of the deal ultimately completing. </p>

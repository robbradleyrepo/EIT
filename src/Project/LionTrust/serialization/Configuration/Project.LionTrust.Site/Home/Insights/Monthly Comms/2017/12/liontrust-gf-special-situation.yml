        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong>The Liontrust GF Special Situations Fund returned -1.2%* in November compared with the -1.7% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">The focus early in the month was on the Bank of England’s historic rate rise, its first for over a decade. The move was well flagged, but the market reaction after the decision suggested that investors do not expect any further tightening in policy in the near future. Sterling slipped following the announcement but during the rest of the month it more than regained the lost value. </p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">General UK equity weakness this month was largely derived from underwhelming earnings reports, with large-cap stocks underperforming (FTSE 100 returning -1.8% compared to the FTSE 250’s -1.2% and the FTSE Small Cap’s -0.8%).</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">Within the Fund, the biggest large cap detractor was <strong>Compass Group </strong>(-9.3%) which fell despite releasing strong full-year numbers. The catering company reported a 15% increase in headline revenue and an 18% improvement in operating profits. Both revenue and profit were boosted by an 11% translational benefit from weaker sterling. Management provided another positive outlook, citing an encouraging pipeline of new contracts and expected progress on efficiencies. However, growth is expected to be second half weighted which slightly disappointed the market. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">Financial intermediary companies <strong>TP ICAP </strong>(-7.1%) and <strong>NEX Group </strong>(-6.5%) were both among the weakest performers following updates. TP ICAP noted a 3% year-on-year increase in pro forma revenue in the third quarter of 2017 despite mixed market conditions. However, the group stated that the outlook for the fourth quarter remains challenging and that its chief financial officer was stepping down. NEX Group released interim results for the six months to end September. The company reported a fall in pre-tax profit to £48m from £66m last year, impacted by an £11m hit from one-off items and increases in underlying effective tax rate. The company also rebased its dividend payment to 3.5p from 11.5p.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">Despite the decline this month, there were positive stories to note. <strong>Bango </strong>(+13.1%) announced two new deals, boosting its share price. The mobile payments company expanded its direct carrier billing services to Amazon Prime customers in Japan. It also launched operator-billed payments for Google Play users with 9mobile in Nigeria. </p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong>Kainos Group’s</strong> (+10.8%) share price rose following the release of interim results. The IT services and consulting company recorded a 2% annual increase in revenue and 5% improvement in pre-tax profit, which Kainos stated was in line with market expectations. The group lifted its dividend payment by 5% and indicated that it remains well placed to deliver growth in the coming years.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">Temporary power supplier <strong>Aggreko</strong> (-9.3%) reported higher revenue for the third quarter of 2017, but its Power Solutions Utility business saw a 15% decrease in revenue due to repricing and off-hires in Argentina. The company, nonetheless, maintained its guidance for the full-year. </p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">Software-as-a-service provider <strong>dotdigital Group</strong> (+5.6%) acquired the Comapi group of companies for £11m. Comapi is focused on the omni-channel messaging and cloud communication market and reported revenue of £7.8m in 2016. Management stated the addition will extend dotdigital’s marketing automation platform and also expands the group’s services beyond the UK.&nbsp; </p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong>Positive contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;">Bango (+13.1%), Kainos Group (+10.8%), Fidessa Group (+8.0%), Renishaw (+7.3%) and dotdigital Group (+5.6%).</p>

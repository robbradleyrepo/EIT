        <p><strong>If you type in Google &ldquo;why are bankers not&rdquo; then the suggested completed sentence is &ldquo;in jail&rdquo;. Banks, and their employees, generally have a bad reputation as is highlighted in the chart below. Since 2008, there have been a plethora of situations where the profession has hardly covered itself in glory.<br>

        We take a pragmatic view to the industry. How much more difficult would life be without somewhere to safely deposit funds, to have an account to make and receive payments, and an institution to provide loans and mortgages?</p>
        <p><img alt="Veracity Index 2015" src="-/media/F3D6BD60553141A8AB59E3D7CD0EDD73.ashx?h=670&amp;w=454&amp;hash=FFB767F31F91027354AE7FCA36EE6C12BBEF748F&amp;hash=FFB767F31F91027354AE7FCA36EE6C12BBEF748F" style="height: 670px; width: 454px;"></p>
        <p><strong>
        How do banks work?</strong></p>
        <p>
        The banking sector covers a wide range of intermediary financial services: loan-making and deposit-taking; corporate finance; market making in equities, fixed income and other markets; account administration; payment services and not forgetting the creation of money.</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
        Banks operate with a fractional reserve model whereby they hold liquid assets equal to only a small portion of their liabilities (deposits). So there is a disconnect between the promise of instant access for depositors and the reality that only a fraction of depositors could withdraw their money at any one time. This only works if there is trust in the banking institution and depositors are comfortable that the bank is a secure place for their cash.</p>
        <p><strong>
        We divide the sector into two types:</strong></p>
        <p>
        &bull; Investment banks raise financial capital for corporations, assist in mergers and acquisitions, and make markets in equities, fixed income and derivatives thereof. As part of this they may provide &lsquo;sell-side&rsquo; research services. They generally do not take deposits.&nbsp;<br>
        &bull; Corporate and retail banks take deposits and make loans &ndash; &lsquo;lending long and borrowing short&rsquo; to individuals and companies.<br>
        Our view is that there is a clear need and opportunity for banks to play a pivotal role in society. As such, we see them as providing net benefits to society, provided they are well-managed.</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Tying it all together</strong></span></p>
        <p>
        We identify the main ESG factors that can have tangible impacts on both their contribution to financial resilience in the broader economy &ndash; we believe this is intrinsically linked to the long-term sustainability of the bank &ndash; and also to individual stock performance. There are too many to list them here but I have included an example below for illustrative purposes.</p>
        <p><img height="287" alt="ESG Factors/Financial Impact" width="454" src="-/media/BFBFF9F5081A4958BAB52E38443A3DCC.ashx?h=287&amp;w=454&amp;hash=98095AE4F4671EBA3A8DB07ED44CFFBEEFAB1B87&amp;hash=98095AE4F4671EBA3A8DB07ED44CFFBEEFAB1B87" style="height: 287px; width: 454px;"></p>
        <p>On top of this, we recognise the role banks can play in achieving the Sustainable Development goals and in the diagram below we have attempted to identify the key goals and themes that could drive value up to 2020.</p>
        <p><img alt="Sustainable Development Goals" src="-/media/BB1E4E3C01D04B458D1F071070143032.ashx?h=439&amp;w=462&amp;hash=7E05CD7A5010CC698685DDA4762E1043CFD2B4F6&amp;hash=7E05CD7A5010CC698685DDA4762E1043CFD2B4F6" style="height: 439px; width: 462px;"><br>

        <strong>Potential Winners</strong></p>
        <p>We prefer traditional retail banks over investment banking as we see much clearer benefits to society and, as investors, we perceive the volatility inherent in investment banking earnings as undesirable. It is of paramount importance to us that the banks we invest in are well-managed and have policies in place to ensure the products they offer are appropriate to the client. Based on our analysis, KBC Groep and Intesa Sanpaolo are both examples of excellently managed banks that are adequately capitalised and well-positioned to withstand any potential shocks to the broader economy. We also like Shawbrook Group, an SME-focused UK bank, which in our view, because of its positioning in niche and often underserved markets, is both well-capitalised and highly profitable.</p>

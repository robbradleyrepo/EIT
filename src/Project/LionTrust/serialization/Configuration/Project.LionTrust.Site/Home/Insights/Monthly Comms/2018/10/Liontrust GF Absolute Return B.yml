        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The Liontrust GF Absolute Return Bond Fund was launched in June 2018. Since the track record is less than one year, regulatory restrictions prevent presentation of performance data in this report.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>We are pleased with the Fund’s first few months, which were set against a backdrop of continued US rate rises: the yield on 2 year US Treasuries increased from 2.53% to 2.82%.&nbsp; Some of the Fund’s market carry was eroded by the mark-to-market increase in term interest rates but decision making within the alpha sources of the Fund added value over the quarter.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Carry Component</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span><br>We have a strong preference for US-dollar denominated carry in the Fund at the moment, due to the steeper short end of the yield curve in the US. The yield differential between base rates and 1 - 2 year Treasuries allows one to purchase 2019 and 2020 maturity debt issued by high quality companies for yields in excess of 3%, providing a significant cushion against the anticipated further rate rises. The duration contribution of the Fund’s carry component is expected to average approximately 1.5 years through the cycle; given the current rates backdrop the Fund has been recently running nearer 1.1 years to help protect against mark-to-market losses.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The vast majority of the holdings in the carry component will be held until their maturity. There was one exception during Q3; bonds issued by Ford were sold after a more severe credit rating downgrade than anticipated. We expected a cut from BBB to BBB- but not the retention of a negative outlook from Moody’s. The position was reviewed and then rapidly sold, avoiding any significant cost for the Fund.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Alpha Sources</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>(i) Rates</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span><br>Canadian government bonds have been beneficiaries of President Trump’s hostile trade talk and tariff threats.&nbsp; We believed that yields had fallen far too low relative to those in the US and established a short Canadian futures/long US futures position which proved successful and tactically profits were taken. Longer term we think further convergence is likely and the position was re-established at a differential of 0.65%. With the late-September announcement of a new trade agreement to replace NAFTA (USMCA) this augurs well for this position into Q4 2018.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The Fund established a position in US 5-year inflation breakevens during August; US 5-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) were purchased and the equivalent duration contribution removed using US Treasury futures. The inflation breakeven, the inflation rate at which you are equally rewarded for holding TIPS or conventional debt, had fallen from 2.10% in early July to 1.95% during August. The majority of this reduction in the TIPS market’s inflation expectations was due to the prior strength in the dollar and neglected to reflect that the very reason the dollar has been strong is that growth is rampant and US headline inflation is running at 2.9%.&nbsp; By the end of the quarter, breakevens had retraced to 2.05% and the Fund reduced its position from 0.5 years to 0.25 years.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>(ii) Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span><br>There was a reasonable tightening in the credit spreads of Rabobank 2022 maturity lower tier 2 bonds over the quarter. This was partly reversing an oversold situation, which the Fund had capitalised on, and also aided by the future supply/demand dynamics from the issuer. Rabobank will be issuing more “non-preferred” senior debt, as opposed to lower tier 2, in order to meet its regulatory liability requirements.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Bayer, the German pharmaceutical and life sciences company, raised a large quantity of debt earlier this year. The Fund invested in some of the low beta shorter dated floating rate notes. When the Monsanto lawsuit news arose the bonds fell 0.5%, but still remained above what we paid for them. This was a simple decision to lock in the remaining profit – once a company attracts the attention of the US courts, bond holders need to be wary.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><sup><span><br>† </span></sup><em><span>Adjusted underlying duration is based on the correlation of the instruments as opposed to just the mathematical weighted average of cash flows.&nbsp; High yield companies' bonds exhibit less duration sensitivity as the credit risk has a bigger proportion of the total yield; the lower the credit quality the less rate-sensitive the bond.&nbsp; Additionally, some subordinated financials also have low duration correlations and the bonds trade on a cash price rather than spread.&nbsp;<br><br></span></em></p>

        Key Risks&nbsp;<br>
        </strong><br>
        Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.<br>

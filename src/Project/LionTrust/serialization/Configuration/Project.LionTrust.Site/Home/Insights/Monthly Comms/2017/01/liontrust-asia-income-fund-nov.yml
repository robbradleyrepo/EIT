            <li><strong>Sold – China Communication Construction. </strong>We sold the Fund’s holding in this Chinese transportation infrastructure group at a significant profit, having originally invested at the Fund’s launch in early March 2012. The company continues to gain new contracts as the Chinese government has accelerated its rollout of contracts this year. China Communication has signed approximately Rmb600bn of new projects so far in the year to November, which gives it an impressive order backlog of over Rmb1tn. While this is testament to its success, it comes at the cost of a weaker balance sheet as these projects tend to be capital intensive (over Rmb265bn were build-operate-transfer projects at the end of June). The company’s gearing had already increased to a net ratio of approximately 1.2x by the end of September. While the low interest rate environment has helped the company (China cut rates 5 times in 2015 and they have been stable in 2016), the recent increase in commodity prices might lead to lower margins. These increased forward-looking risks led to the sale of the position.</li>
            <li><strong>Bought – Infratil. </strong>An infrastructure investment company with most of its revenues arising from New Zealand and Australia, Infratil invests in projects with development potential with a focus on sectors such as energy, transport, retirement and telecom infrastructure. Infratil is trading at a c.20% discount to NAV with a dividend yield of more than 5.5%.</li>
            <li><strong>Bought – Man Wah. </strong>The company is the market leading producer of reclining sofas in China and the third largest in the US. We expect it to benefit from rising popularity of reclining sofas in China and it should increase its market share in the US. Man Wah has a strong balance sheet with a net cash position and positive free cash flow generation. It trades at less than 13x forward P/E with a dividend yield of around 4.5%.</li>

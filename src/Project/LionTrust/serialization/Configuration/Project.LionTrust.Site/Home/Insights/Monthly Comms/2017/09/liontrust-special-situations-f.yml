        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust Special Situations Fund returned 0.5%* in August, compared with the 1.4% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></p>
        <p>Although geopolitical risks appeared to mount in August with Trump’s threat to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea, evidence of risk aversion in equity markets was weak. The Vix index of implied US equity market volatility did spike intra-month to 16%, but it then retraced back to near its starting level of about 10%. For UK investors, the depreciation of the pound was again a key factor, contributing to the FTSE 100 Index’s (+1.6%) outperformance of the FTSE 250 Index (+0.4%) and FTSE Small Cap Index (+0.5%).</p>
        <p> Mining stocks were among the best-performing in the large-cap index, buoyed by their non-sterling exposure and a pick-up in commodity prices. The absence of mining stocks from the Fund due to their lack of Economic Advantage characterises was therefore a relative headwind during the month. The Fund did however participate in the trend to re-rate international consumer goods stocks on the back of pound weakness. <strong>Diageo</strong> (+7.5%) and <strong>Unilever</strong> (+5.3%) were among the Fund’s strongest performances. Diageo also completed the acquisition of Casamigos, the premium US tequila brand founded by a group including George Clooney.</p>
        <p>The biggest portfolio mover in the month was the <strong>AA</strong> (-34.5%), whose shares tumbled after announcing that its Executive Chairman Bob Mackenzie had been removed from his role with immediate effect due to “gross misconduct”. It’s a rather well-worn maxim, but markets really do hate uncertainty, and the share price reaction here – as the company created a news vacuum by declining to publicly elaborate – really illustrates that. Although an extremely unfortunate and unforeseen development, the market’s response in wiping one-third off the company’s equity value seems to us to be overdone. We invest in businesses for their possession of Economic Advantage in the form of intangible barriers to competition – in the AA’s case this includes a dominant market position and extremely high levels of recurring revenue. In our experience these intangible assets, and the barriers to competition they create, are unlikely to be affected by this development, and they are much more important in creating long-term value than the management teams whose fiduciary duty it is to manage them.</p>
        <p>Among the positive portfolio contributors, <strong>Intertek’s</strong> (+18.8%) interim results showed the benefits of sterling weakness to companies selling their products globally: group revenue for the quality assurance specialist jumped by 13.9% to £1.37bn. Growth was still very respectable once currency gains are adjusted for – rising by 2.7% at constant currency rates, of which 1.7 percentage points were organic growth. Strong free cash flow allowed the company to increase its interim dividend by over 20% to 23.5p. It also recorded a 90bps expansion in operating margin at constant currencies which it credits to a refocus towards recently acquired high-margin businesses.</p>
        <p>Investors in <strong>Smart Metering Systems</strong> (+14.6%) welcomed the news that the company had signed a new meter rental agreement with Utility Warehouse. The contract will see it provide a minimum of 100,000 new domestic smart meters. The deal is another example of how Smart Metering Systems is benefiting from the UK requirement that domestic energy supply companies have smart meters fitted for all residential and small business customers by 2020.</p>
        <p><strong>Shire</strong> eased off by 10% in August after releasing Q2 results into what was still a weak market for pharma stocks following AstraZeneca’s setback in July. Quarterly revenue growth excluding the impact the Baxalta acquisition was 7%, with immunology growing 17%. The company announced a possible listing of its neuroscience division as part of a strategic review which is to be completed by year-end. It also disclosed that its CFO will be leaving at the end of the year.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p>Intertek Group (+18.8%), Smart Metering Systems (+14.6%) Renishaw (+9.8%), Diageo (+7.5%) and Unilever (+5.3%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors included:</strong></p>
        <p>AA (-34.5%), Shire (-10.0%), Idox (-6.9%), Fidessa (-6.7%) and Spectris (-5.9%).</p><p><br></p>

        <p>• Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</p>

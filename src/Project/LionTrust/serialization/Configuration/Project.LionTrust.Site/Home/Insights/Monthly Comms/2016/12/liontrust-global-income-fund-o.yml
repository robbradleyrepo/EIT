        <div><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></div>

        <div>The Fund returned +5.1%* in sterling terms in October compared with the +4.2% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Much of the sterling-terms return from investing in global equities during October derived from the weakness of the pound as talk of &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo; gathered momentum. So while the MSCI World returned 4.3% in sterling, in local currency terms it fell 0.7%.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Action in debt markets was more marked than equity markets, as global bonds suffered a sharp sell-off driven by an upward shift in the benchmark yield curve. In the US, yields on 10 year Treasury bills rose 13bps. Contributory factors include the US rate rise which is expected at the FOMC&rsquo;s December meeting, and the ongoing recovery and stabilisation of the oil price. In Europe, despite further speculation that the ECB will extend its asset-purchase programme, the yield on the German 10 year bund rose 28bps. In the UK, better than expected Q3 GDP was also a factor in gilt yields rising 50bps. But sterling continued its weak trend, falling 5.6% and 3.4% versus the US$ and euro respectively as worries of a &ldquo;hard Brexit&rdquo; mounted, taking the total depreciation since June&rsquo;s Brexit vote to 18% and 15% respectively.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The Fund&rsquo;s overweight positions in energy and materials gave it good exposure to some of the strongest areas in global equity markets in October, and helped offset negative attribution from its lower weighting in financials. The Fund remains substantially underweight to the US as we believe is one of the most overvalued markets globally. The US dollar was, however, one of the strongest currencies in October, meaning that Fund largely missed out on the translation boost that many peer funds will have benefited from. Sterling fell 4.2% in trade-weighted terms, but 5.6% versus the dollar.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Trends in currency, geography and sector were a bigger influence than company newsflow on stock movements within the portfolio. BP (+3.7%), Total (+7.4%) and Suncor Energy (+3.2% prior to its sale) rose alongside the energy sector while Severstal (+23.9%) and Rio Tinto (+10.3%) participated in a rally in basic materials.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>On the downside, Genworth MI Canada shares were adversely affected by measures brought in by the Canadian government designed to regulate mortgage insurance rules. The measures include tougher stress test and eligibility requirements on new mortgages. Genworth provides mortgage default insurance policies and stated that much of the business it has written this year would not have been possible under the new rules, although there may now be a compensatory increase in premium rates.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>In October, RR Donnelley completed the spin out of two new separately listed businesses &ndash; LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions &ndash;and subsequently applied a 1-for-3 stock consolidation to its shares.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Further portfolio changes were implemented during the month: Suncor Energy and Chorus Aviation were sold, and Ensign Energy Services was added.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></div>
        <div>Severstal (+23.9%), Deutsche Pfandbriefbank (+16.5%) and VTech Holdings (+14.2%).</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></div>
        <div>RR Donnelley &amp; Sons (-26.2%), Genworth MI Canada (-10.4%) and Ensign Energy Services (-11.4%).</div>

        <div>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Investment in the Fund carries the risk of potential total&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">loss of capital. Investment in the Fund involves a foreign currency and may be subject to fluctuations in value&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">due to movements in exchange rates. A portion of the Fund&rsquo;s expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">of increasing the distribution and constraining the Fund&rsquo;s capital performance.</span></div>

        <p><strong><span style="color: black;">Recent outperformance from index-linked bonds obscures an extremely expensive asset class, with higher duration risk than conventional equivalents and negative returns if held to maturity.</span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Investors owning index-linked gilts have benefited as the fall in nominal yields has driven prices up; for most however, the rationale for buying these bonds was to protect themselves from higher inflation rather than seeking a capital gain. To provide a quick recap, these bonds offer both capital and interest linked to the RPI (</span>retail prices index)<span style="color: black;">.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">As such, these investors have been right but for the wrong reasons and they need to be aware of what they are locked into, in terms of long-term return profile and medium-term risks to capital.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Current pricing of index-linked bonds has little to do with inflation risks, particularly as we are in a period of a proven independent central bank in the UK with an explicit inflation mandate. Just consider the current implied breakeven rate, the average inflation required for index-linked bonds to produce the same total return as the equivalent maturity conventional gilt on a buy and hold basis. Given the index-linked market is now pricing in around 3.0%-3.5% inflation as far as 50 years out, this demonstrates just how expensive this market has become.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">If you see conventional government bonds as expensive at present then, you really have to dislike linkers. The 2040 index-linked bond currently trades at a yield of -2.30%, so buy and hold investors will receive inflation less 2.30%. So, if inflation is 2.0% over the next 20 years, investors will receive a total return of -0.30% per annum for the period and a total real return of -2.30% a year.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">Using the same assumptions, the conventional gilt will produce a total return of +0.97% per annum and a total real return of -1.33%.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">While both markets are expensive, as highlighted above it is clear that index-linked bonds are significantly more overvalued: for the index-linked 2040 to outperform the conventional gilt, inflation would need to average 3.26% for the next 20 years relative to a Bank of England target of 2%.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;"><br>
        In addition to more extreme valuations, index-linked debt also typically has more duration than equivalent maturity conventional gilts: the 2040 index-linked gilt has duration of 20 years for example so if yields rise by 1%, the capital price falls by around 20% (and vice-versa if yields fall 1%). </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">In comparison, the 2040 conventional gilt has a duration of &lsquo;only&rsquo; 15 years: in that case, a 1% rise in yields leads to a capital decline of circa 15%.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">In summary, there is no motivation for retail investors to own index-linked gilts. Even in the environment where inflation overshoots the breakeven rate required to outperform the conventional market, this would be a horrible period for conventional and index-linked debt given that all yields would reprice materially higher than current market levels. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">While index-linked bonds might outperform in these conditions, they would be suffering significant mark-to-market capital losses, an unwinding of the gains government bonds have experienced over recent years as yields have trended to historic lows. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">A further potential drawback for current owners of index-linked bonds in the UK is the uncertainty around how inflation is calculated</span>. Earlier this month, chancellor Sajid Javid outlined plans to reform RPI to correct flaws in the way it is calculated &mdash; a change that will move the measure significantly lower in line with the alternative consumer price index including housing costs (CPIH). </p>
        <p>With linkers currently aligned to RPI, it is unclear how this proposal will affect the future of these bonds as the gap between RPI and CPIH inflation tends to run at around one percentage point. </p>

        <strong><span>Key Risks </span></strong></span></strong><span><br>
        <br>
        <strong><span>Past performance is not a guide to future performance.</span></strong> Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The majority of the Liontrust Sustainable Future Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Some of these funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well-regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and has a concentrated portfolio of securities, there is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund&rsquo;s share price. Liontrust SF Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Corporate Bond Fund, Liontrust SF Cautious Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Defensive Managed Fund and Liontrust Monthly Income Bond Fund invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions, it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the bonds held by these funds. Mentioned above five funds can also invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interests rates move or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions.<br>

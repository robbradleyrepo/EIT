        <div><strong>Over the past 18 months, a select group of influential bankers and stakeholders have worked together to produce a report which explores how to rebuild a healthy banking sector in the UK.<br>
        </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br>
        The report, based on the views of over 200 senior banking leaders, investors, sector experts, customers and civil society stakeholders, highlights three key recommendations to bank leaders:<br>
        <br>
        </span></div>
        <div>1. Bank to better serve the real economy&rsquo;s current and future needs </div>
        <div>2. Bank leaders commit to work with the Investor Forum to create banking and investment cultures that enable the sector to deliver long-term value </div>
        <div>3. Bank leaders commit to a public process involving consumers, civil society and regulators to improve their duty of care and respect for customers.</div>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br>
        &ldquo;The financial crisis was a painful reminder that commercial banks should operate for the good of the public, their customers. Now we must tackle the question of what banking system we do want. Banking Futures is an important initiative involving a wide group of stakeholders. It has a call to leadership, to respect customers and to support our economy. The report is an important start but it must not gather dust. Now we must make the change happen.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p style="color: #222222; margin: 0px 0px 14px;"><strong>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital.</strong><strong></strong>The issue of units/shares in Liontrust Funds may be subject to an initial charge, which will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term. Investments should always be considered as long term.</p>

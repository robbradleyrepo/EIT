        <p><b>For investment professionals only</b><br><br>The Fund returned 1.2%* in euro terms in December, compared with the 5.8% return from the MSCI Europe Index and the -0.1% return of the HFRX Equity Hedge EUR Index. Net exposure at month end was c.58%. During the month the Fund’s exposure to the market was increased modestly to reflect a more positive signal from our proprietary indicators. In December, the long book contributed c.4.4% while the short book detracted c.2.4%†.<br><br>
        The rally seen in markets since the US Presidential election (and the pro-growth rhetoric of fiscal stimulus from the President-elect) continued in a more aggressive fashion in December. The S&amp;P 500 Index reached a new high of 2271 on 13 December, delivered a total return of 1.9% over the month and 11.2% over 2016 (in US dollar terms). Helped by a strong performance in December, European markets had recouped most of the early 2016 losses, ending the year down just 0.5% in capital terms and posting a positive total return of 2.6% (both in euro terms).<br><br>
        All sectors in the MSCI Europe Index rose during the month. In a pattern which has become familiar in recent months, energy and financials were among the strongest performing sectors, up 10.4% and 6.7% respectively in euro terms. These sector trends continue to be affected by the OPEC production cut announcement and the ongoing rise in bond yields. The biggest laggards during December’s rally included materials, rising 3.7% and consumer staples, up 4.4%.<br>
        As equity markets reached new highs in some regions, US debt markets continued their sell-off, albeit more modestly. The yield on US 10 year Treasury bills rose 6bps to 2.44%, with the FOMC’s December announcement of a 25bps rise in US interest rates already largely discounted. However, the accompanying indication that three further rate hikes should be expected in 2017 (versus two at the earlier September meeting) – with the same number forecast for 2018 and 2019 – was perhaps slightly more hawkish than expected.<br><br>
        In Europe however, the yield on the German 10 year bund reversed recent gains, falling by 7bps during the month. Similarly, UK gilt yields fell 18bps. Following last month’s rally in sterling, the currency depreciated just over 1% against the US dollar and 0.7% versus the euro.<br><br>
        In the Fund’s long book, the strongest performer was Oriflame, the Swedish beauty product retailer. Last month the stock fell sharply despite strong Q3 results, as management commented that Q4 trading had been more volatile. The shares had rallied substantially prior to that point, so the comments prompted some significant profit taking. However, this retracement appeared overdone and in December the shares recouped some of the previous months’ losses – rising by 19.5%.<br><br>
        Another highlight in the long book was Burford Capital, the UK based litigation financing company. The shares rose 21%, reacting positively to the announcement of the acquisition of US peer Gerchen Keller Capital. Burford Capital announced the acquisition would be immediately enhancing to earnings and the acquired portfolio of AUM totalling US$1.3bn would enhance its scale and bring attractive recurring revenues. The total consideration for the acquisition is US$160m in a combination of cash, equity and loan notes with potential for a further US$15m in equity contingent on performance.<br><br>
        There were no major negative contributors to the long book during the month. A modest negative contribution came from JD Sports Fashion, the UK sports retailer. The shares fell 5.2% in response to a media report regarding worker exploitation at a distribution centre. The company responded by launching a review into the implementation of its policies at the centre.<br><br>
        The short book’s negative contribution is primarily a reflection of the strong rally in equity markets. On a stock-specific basis, one of the weakest individual short positions was in a Swiss biotech company whose shares rose on positive newsflow. The company received Notice of Allowance from the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office covering “the most commercially viable production method for manufacturing best-tasting steviol glycosides”. A further detractor from performance was a Spanish gaming company. The shares rose after it received approval to acquire the remaining 50% of a South American race track management company.<br></p><p><br><b>Performance since launch (%)</b></p><b>

        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: justify;">The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned 3.6%* in May, compared with the 1.8% return from the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index.</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">With the UK General Election looming, the erosion of the Conservatives’ lead in polls was reflected in sterling weakness (-2.8% in trade weighted terms) and the underperformance of mid and small caps relative to their more internationally diverse large-cap peers. The FTSE 250 Index and FTSE Small Cap (ex IT) Index returns of 2.2% and 1.8% lagged the FTSE 100 Index’s 4.9% gain. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Within the Fund we observed a level of share price activity which seemed to be at a disconnect to underlying fundamental developments; 24 of the Fund’s 66 holdings registered a double-digit percentage move on the month. Thankfully, only two of these moves were to the downside. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Against a backdrop of ongoing positive investor sentiment, a number of stocks were able to rally strongly despite either issuing no newsflow or simply stating that trading has been in-line with expectations. Two of the portfolio’s largest share price moves were however driven by changes to management’s financial guidance. ECO Animal Health Group (+19.0%), the producer of animal health pharmaceuticals, released a short statement stating that revenue and profit before tax for its full-year to the end of March were likely to come in ahead of market expectations. The company is due to release results on 30 June. This contrasted with the update from K3 Business Technology (-35.5%), whose share price fell sharply after it warned that results for the year to 30 June will be significantly below market expectations. Its interim results, which were released in March, were affected by contract slippages in its Enterprise division. In May, the company stated that certain large Enterprise contracts have still not been secured as expected, leading to the downgrade to guidance. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Concurrent Technologies (+28.6%) saw its shares rise very strongly despite the company’s only update to investors consisting of a brief AGM statement which confirmed that turnover and operating profit in the first four months of 2017 are both in line with its expectations. It also stated that its cash position remains strong. Shares in the company – which manufactures embedded computer boards for critical applications in markets such defence and aerospace – rallied strongly after the release of full year results in March, and took another leg higher in May.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">First Derivatives (+18.4%) and PayPoint (-7.0%) both issued final results in May (for the 12 months to 28 February and 31 March respectively) but while the former’s were well received, Paypoint’s share price edged lower. First Derivatives reported upbeat final results, with revenue rising 30% year-on-year driven by strong growth in its software business. Furthermore, the company stated it had made an encouraging start to the current financial year and anticipates another year of strong growth. PayPoint (-7.0%) on the other hand released full year results that painted a picture of a company in transition. Net revenues were flat year-on-year at £124m, but stripping out the impact of non-core businesses sold (Online &amp; Mobile) its retail net revenue grew 6% to £118m. PayPoint provides a payments and parcel delivery network operating from over 40,000 convenience stores. As part of its refocus, it is looking to develop a new payment service offering which will compensate for an anticipated decline in customers using cash to pay utility bills over the counter. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In the portfolio’s only change in the month, the position in Wilmington was sold due to Board ownership falling below the Fund’s 3% minimum level.</p>

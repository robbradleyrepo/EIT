        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned 1.6%* in July. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index returned 3.1%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned 1.9% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was 3.3%.</strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p>Second quarter trading statements came in thick and fast in July ahead of interim results. <strong>Quixant </strong>(+18.5%) was one of the companies to release an update, with the gaming platform designer and manufacturer noting that trading in the first six months of 2017 was “stronger than previously anticipated”. It added that it expects to report revenue of US$56m, which would be an improvement on the US$41.3m it made at the half year stage in 2016.<strong> </strong><strong>Mortgage Advice Bureau </strong>(+14.1%) announced revenue for the six months to the end of June increased 15% year-on-year driven by a 14% increase in advisers. The company added that current trading is in line with expectations and it foresees further growth in the remainder of the year. </p>
        <p>However, it was not all good news. <strong>Quarto Group </strong>(-43.6%) was the Fund’s largest detractor after it warned that its guidance for 2017 and beyond had been set too high. The illustrated book publishing group added that its interim results will show lower than expected trading, reflecting the ongoing soft retail environment. Meanwhile, <strong>Pennant International’s </strong>(-13.9%) shares declined despite the company stating that it has not seen any loss of confidence among its customer base as a result of Brexit uncertainty and its results for the first half of 2017 are on track to meet the market’s expectations. It also highlighted new contract wins and extensions in the period with Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Japan, HMRC and others. </p>
        <p>Away from second quarter trading statements, <strong>Solid State </strong>(+20.0%) reported upbeat full-year results, with an 8.7% rise in revenue translating to a 4.1% rise in pre-tax profit and a 6% rise at the adjusted level. The company stated that the revenue delays it faced on a number of the antenna projects were offset by the additional batteries revenue from its Creasefield acquisition, as well as reporting a strong order book. <strong>Tracsis </strong>(+17.9%) announced that it had been awarded a significant contract for the provision of its software planning products by a major UK rail operator. The contract, which will be delivered over four years, underpins the company’s confidence for the future and the lack of any negative news during the update should bode well for upcoming final results.</p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p>Meanwhile,<strong> Medica Group</strong> (-7.7%) gave up some of its post IPO gains, despite the company noting in an AGM statement at the end of June that it remains on track to meet the Board’s expectations for 2017 full-year results.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p>There were two new additions to the Fund’s holdings in July: <strong>Surgical Innovations</strong> and <strong>Tatton Asset Management</strong>. Surgical Innovations specialises in designing, developing and manufacturing devices for use in minimal invasive abdominal surgery. It possesses strong intellectual property as several of its products are patent protected and furthermore have regulatory approval to be used in surgery. In addition most of its revenue currently comes from sales of consumables, meaning high repeat if not contracted recurring income.&nbsp; Having put the company on the watch list earlier in the year post a meeting with management, the opportunity to invest at a sensible valuation came thanks to a placing of stock toward the end of the month. The proceeds have been used to acquire their sole UK distributor, Elemental Healthcare, a positive given it was immediately margin enhancing, gave it back control over its route to market, as well as substantially strengthening the management team. </p>
        <p>Tatton Asset Management, which undertook an Initial Public Offering early in the month, offers regulatory compliance and business consulting services, as well as a whole-of-market mortgage provision to directly authorised financial advisers across the UK. In addition it has a disruptive, low cost, on-platform only discretionary fund management offering, which has enjoyed rapid growth in assets under management since it was established in 2013. The company is benefiting from general industry tail-winds as the population is increasingly in need of financial advice due to the ever more complex tax system, and its compliance network provides a solution for IFAs struggling with the burden of regulation. With revenue generated predominantly from subscription and annual fees, the business has high contracted recurring revenue while management still holds a considerable amount of stock. </p>

        <p> • Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.<br>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #333333;"><img height="332" alt="Kiwi" width="600" src="-/media/81F354473AA5474FB47189A0DAD47D20.ashx" class="custom-image-height-auto"></span></strong></p>
        <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">The Kiwi is a small, flightless bird as well as the nickname for the New Zealand Dollar, which plunged overnight and caused markets to take flight.</span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="color: #333333;">Here, in microcosm, is the challenge we now face: this week, the country saw unemployment fall to an 11-year low, wage growth surge and inflation accelerate to 1.7% and yet the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut interest rates half a percentage point&nbsp;to 1%, an all-time record low, citing potential problems ‘overseas’.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #333333;">Quickly, the currency fell more than 2%, just as the US formally labelled China a currency manipulator. Surely to goodness we haven’t come to this? In the decade post financial crisis, central banks and governments around the globe worked together to strengthen the system and promote international economic activity; that period of working for the common good appears to be over.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #333333;"><br>
        Economic data generally remains robust and until recently, I was quite constructive, with New Zealand a case in point. However, we seem to be entering an era of ‘beggar thy neighbour’ competitive exchange rate devaluation, hidden behind talks of ‘insurance cuts’ and ‘potential trouble overseas’.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #333333;">&nbsp;<br>
        I continue to blame the European Central Bank, quantitative easing (QE), negative rates and so on for sparking this monetary policy arms race. Such policies are forcing retaliation and, in my view, have boosted support for populist politics and protectionist trade policy.</span></p>
        <p> <span style="color: #333333;"><br>
        QE and negative rates: a decade-long experiment but we forgot about the Law of Unintended Consequence.</span></p>

        <p style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 14px;"><strong>Key Risks</strong></p>
        <p style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 14px;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The majority of the Liontrust Sustainable Future Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Some of these funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and has a concentrated portfolio of securities, there is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund’s share price. Liontrust SF Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Corporate Bond Fund, Liontrust SF Cautious Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Defensive Managed Fund and Liontrust Monthly Income Bond Fund invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions, it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the bonds held by these funds. Mentioned above five funds can also invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interests rates move or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions.</p>

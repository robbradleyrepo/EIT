        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>A couple of weeks ago, I listed 10 fairly straightforward ways I thought we could make money for clients over the quiet summer months. There has been a lot of feedback – thank you for that. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>However, a couple of people said it was all a bit tame – that most of the trades were designed to add 10 or 20 basis points and, of course, this is the point. The Liontrust Strategic Bond Fund is run as a fairly conservative, risk-adjusted total return vehicle: through the cycle, we are aiming to return around 6% “beta” and hopefully a little alpha on top.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Bond beta is expensive at the moment and I don’t see returns from the basic market approaching 6% for some time, so the importance of alpha is perhaps greater today than at any time during the past 30 years of the fixed interest bull run. Of course, it is possible to find higher alpha, higher-risk trades for bond investors. Some, at the margin, may on occasion make their way into our Funds – I’ve ranked these from one to 10 in terms of order of likelihood. Anyway, for the more risk tolerant of you out there, here we go again: </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">1. Gilts are finally starting to underperform against US Treasuries</strong><br></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>An old favourite of mine – short the UK market, be long US bonds. A long time ago in a company far, far away, I started work. Some would call it the 1980s, I’d call it yesterday. Back then, we investors expected to be paid more to own UK Government bonds than their US equivalents – the UK was a bit of a basket case, inflation was around 3% and rising and we worried we might lose our AAA rating. And, of course, we had signed up to join the European Union. So we all asked the nice people in the Treasury if we could have some more yield on our bonds. And they kindly said yes.</p>
        <p><span>Things have changed a lot since then: inflation is around 3%, we no longer have an AAA rating and we are worried about leaving the EU…. and the yield differential compared with US Treasuries is 5% lower.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Gilts versus Treasuries</span></strong></p>
        <p><img height="245" alt="David Roberts: 10 alternative trades I could have done in summer" width="600" src="-/media/496B4DCE109E4F2A8906C853F33478E3.ashx?h=245&amp;w=600"></p>
        <p><span><i>Source: Bloomberg, as at 30.08.18. Chart shows yield spread between 10-year Gilts and US Treasuries in basis points (bps).</i></span></p>
        <p><span>When does this trend turn? Well, it doesn’t show up on my long-term chart, but a month ago the differential was 1.7%, now it’s 1.54%: a small move perhaps but still already worth 1% in price terms. It is possible gilts will get even more expensive than Treasuries – all we need is renewed quantitative easing nonsense around Brexit. </span></p>
        <p><span>However, betting on gilts is betting against at least 30 years of history – and if history does repeat itself, then the last time we were “out” of the EU, gilt yields were above those of their US cousins. If the differential moves back even to zero (meaning gilts underperform but still look expensive on historic terms), investors make an extra 7.5% from their US government bonds compared with UK equivalents. Sell as many gilts as you can, buy US Treasuries – go away for a year and don’t worry about it.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>2. US Index Linked versus US conventional bonds</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>US inflation is running well above 2% (it was 2.9% in July). Economic policy is still easy and we seem to be in for a protracted period of above target CPI. Short-dated inflation protected bonds are still expecting inflation to be lower than target for the next year or so (and this expectation has fallen recently). This looks wrong. So, sell normal bonds, buy inflation linked and if inflation remains above 2%, pocket the difference.</p>
        <p><strong><span>Index linked versus convention in the US</span></strong></p>
        <p><img height="245" alt="David Roberts: 10 alternative trades I could have done in summer" width="601" src="-/media/A708E3ED8ABD427189831152A70C0A50.ashx?h=245&amp;w=601"></p>
        <p><span><i>Source: Bloomberg, as at 30.08.18. Chart shows yield spread between index-linked and standard US Treasuries in basis points (bps).</i></span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>3. Sell Bayer debt</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>This is actually an easy one (we have done it already). Bayer raised a pile of debt earlier this year. We made a quick, profitable turn on longer-dated euro debt, which was issued much more cheaply than similar maturities in US dollars.&nbsp;We retained exposure to some of the low beta shorter-dated floating rate notes.</p>
        <p><span>Then the Monsanto news hit. The bonds we owned fell 0.5%, still above what we paid for them. This was a no brainer – once a company attracts the attention of the US courts, bondholders need to be wary. </span></p>
        <p><span>Even if Monsanto is the proverbial storm in a tea cup, how high could bond prices go? Could they rally all the way back up 0.5%? As someone famous once said: “When the facts change, I change my mind. What, sir do you do?”</span></p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Sell Bayer?</strong></p>
        <p><img height="245" alt="David Roberts: 10 alternative trades I could have done in summer" width="601" src="-/media/08F3820CEBF34B43AAC4A8C2C124509F.ashx?h=245&amp;w=601"></p>
        <p><span><i>Source: Bloomberg, as at 30.08.18. Chart shows price of Bayer bonds in GBP.</i></span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>4. Geographic and cap structure arbitrage exists at the corporate level too </span></strong></p>
        <p><span>A number of these ideas involve exploiting relative value between the bonds of one country and another. The bond market is not very efficient, plus it tends to mean revert. These types of opportunities also exist at micro/company level situations<strong>. </strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Aroundtown is a German Real Estate business that has grown substantially in recent years. The market environment has been beneficial, with the availability of cheap debt coupled with rising property prices. Aroundtown has grown in a financially prudent manner, consistently raising both debt and equity to fuel growth. </span></p>
        <p><span>In our Strategic Bond Fund, we have held euro denominated bonds, which performed well during a period when similar types of paper lagged. We recently switched this holding into a very similar Aroundtown US dollar denominated bond. In doing so, the Fund gained close to 1% extra spread. Our clients also now own a bond with a substantially lower price, which we believe protects to a degree from (unexpected) downside. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>5. German curve steepener</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>We know the European Central Bank (ECB) is about to stop buying German bunds. We struggle to see who else would buy 30 year debt at 1% (especially given German inflation is above 2%). To avoid a “directional” trade – although we like that too – why not sell 30 years and buy 10 year ones? </span></p>
        <p><span>30 year bonds yield about 66 basis points more than 10 year, actually quite close to long-term averages. However, as the chart shows, this thing is volatile: put it another way – in addition to the logic of the trade, history shows that if you take a position, sooner or later you’ll make money.</span></p>
        <p><span></span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Bunds: 30-year versus 10</strong></p>
        <p><img height="245" alt="David Roberts: 10 alternative trades I could have done in summer" width="601" src="-/media/79A6C0A9F9514A9CB622C8BCB871C22A.ashx?h=245&amp;w=601"></p>
        <p><i><span>Source: Bloomberg, as at 30.08.18. </span><span>Chart shows yield spread between 30-Year and 10-year Bunds in basis points.</span></i></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: black;">6. Identify “rising stars”</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>Credit improvement stories can lead to decent capital upside for bondholders.&nbsp;As companies transition upwards from high yield to investment grade, this is rewarded with much tighter bond spreads and a significantly larger buyer base.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>A good example is GLPI (Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc), a gaming focused Real Estate Investment Trust.&nbsp;GLPI increased the diversity of tenants in its core casino business, leading to credit rating upgrades. Fitch joined S&amp;P at rating the bonds BBB in August and this took the average rating to investment grade.&nbsp;The bonds rallied 3% (for us, this is a lot) and we will now look to take profits once the index tracking investment grade buyers appear at these inflated prices.</span></p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">GLPI </strong><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">– a rising star</strong></p>
        <p><img height="245" alt="David Roberts: 10 alternative trades I could have done in summer" width="600" src="-/media/73DFCE19CE274306AB071CBA9C449347.ashx?h=245&amp;w=600"></p>
        <p><span><i>Source: Bloomberg, as at 30.08.18. Chart shows price of GLPI bonds in GBP.</i></span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>7. Not all emerging markets (EMs) are created equal</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>With better (North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) chat and a rallying US Treasury market, hard currency Mexican debt has been delightful during the Turkish crisis. Of course, Mexico remains a key part of EM indices. So, if capital flows turn really ugly, the index and all those passive investors will drill Mexican local currency debt and we can expect a spillover into the hard currency world. </span></p>
        <p><span>If capital flows remain benign, then Mexico will underperform the rest of EM: so either buy US Treasuries or buy Turkey or you could sit on the fence and hold on to Mexico. The chart below shows how well Mexico has performed relative to the core EM bond basket.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Mexico versus emerging markets</span></strong></p>
        <p><img height="238" alt="David Roberts: 10 alternative trades I could have done in summer" width="600" src="-/media/D1B0ED7076BC493ABDFC574CAB51C182.ashx?h=238&amp;w=600"></p>
        <p><span><i>Source: Bloomberg, as at 30.08.18. Chart shows price of Mexican 10-year bonds versus basket of core EM bonds. </i></span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>8. Buy Italian sovereign debt, short Italian corporate debt</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>One of the wonders of the modern world is the fact many Italian corporate borrowers pay less for their debt than the sovereign itself. This is because most euro corporate debt is priced relative to German bunds. Some corporates of course have well diversified global income streams; some, including many Italian banks, do not. </span></p>
        <p><span>Buying cheap, generic state risk and selling expensive specific state linked risk ones may cause a few sleepless nights. But it might just make you enough money to buy a case or two of Chianti. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>9. Short South Korean bonds and buy Indian</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>A simple value trade: sometimes it is easy to overcomplicate bond markets. Indian bonds have fallen because the economy is doing well; South Korean debt has risen because the economy (mainly China’s) is slowing a little. </span></p>
        <p><span>The RBI has acted to take some of the heat out of the Indian economy and there are signs this is working – the CPI for example has fallen from 5% to 4.2%. Meanwhile, the Chinese authorities are easing monetary policy. A rebound (or stabilisation) of activity and Korean bonds may lose some of their shine. Spreads between the two have widened 70 basis points in recent months – 3.5% to 4% in terms of price. This looks too much and if it reverts could hand investors a nice little windfall.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>10. Buy US Bonds unhedged</span></strong> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Anyone who knows us, knows we run our funds hedged. We think currency trading is dangerous, volatile and a great way to give investors risks they didn’t want. This is last on the list because we definitely won’t be dabbling. However, we were asked recently how would we go about making a 7% return for UK or European clients.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Hypothetically speaking, I would buy the US high yield market and not hedge the currency – after all, unhedged funds are standard in the equity market. The US high yield market is already yielding around 6.25%. At the time of writing, sterling is worth $1.29: a move to $1.28 “makes” me 0.75%, which added to the 6.25% generates the magic 7%.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Strong sterling</strong></p>
        <img height="245" alt="David Roberts: 10 alternative trades I could have done in summer" width="600" src="-/media/186F21A656634650B5C840324795F36B.ashx?h=245&amp;w=600">&nbsp;
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span><i>Source: Bloomberg, as at 30.08.18. Chart shows sterling spot price.</i></span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Of course, a nice Brexit and we could see sterling back up toward $1.40, which loses me 8.5% on the currency and gives a total loss of 2.25%. Then again, you don’t get currency returns for free – which is perhaps worth examining next time you buy an equity or indeed many a bond fund.</span></p>

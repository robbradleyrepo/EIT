        <strong>For investment professionals only</strong><br>
        <br>
        <div><b>The Fund returned 3.2%* in sterling terms in December compared with the 3.6% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</b></div><div><br>
        Developed equity markets continued their rally into year-end, the MSCI World adding 3.5% to finish 2016 with a total return of 28.2%. Firming expectations for US growth since the election result have not only fuelled the US market rally, they have contributed to further strengthening in the US dollar. The dollar appreciated 1.3% in trade-weighted terms in December, building on November’s 2.3% gain, and is now at a 14 year high. This trend has represented a headwind to emerging markets, restricting the MSCI Emerging Market Index’s December return to 1.3%, albeit it remains the better performing index over 2016.</div><div><br>
        The US Federal Reserve raised rates by 0.25% in a widely anticipated move, and confirmed the futures market’s presumption that rate tightening will now move ahead at a faster pace, adjusting its 2017 median forecast from a 50bps increase in rates to 75bps.</div><div><br>
        The strength in European equity markets was sufficient to push them into an uptrend as defined by the technical measures we employ, up from a neutral trend regime. Our analysis suggests that the establishment of an equity uptrend is usually characterised by further positive returns as well as subdued volatility. There is clearly scope for the heavy electoral timetable in the EU this year to disrupt this more benign picture. However, we prefer to make no predictions about the ramifications of what may or may not occur in Europe’s political scene.</div><div><br>
        In December there was some unwinding of the previous month’s pattern of cyclical outperformance of defensives. The MSCI World’s utilities (+5.5%) and telecoms (+7.1%) sectors recovered from their ‘bond-proxy’ woes while industrials (+2.0%) and consumer discretionary (+2.5%) were the laggards. Two sectors which continued to forge ahead were energy (+4.8%) and financials (+5.2%). These two were the top risers over the fourth quarter, making 12.1% and 19.9% returns respectively, helped by rising interest rate expectations and oil prices.</div><div><br>
        Despite this strong rally, we still find that there is reasonably wide dispersion of share valuations in these two sectors, especially when compared with the rest of the market, and this is suggestive of further opportunity for value picks to perform well. In December we were able to add one such stock to the portfolio – Lukoil, the Russian oil exploration and production company.</div><div><br>
        BPost (+10.6%) recovered from last month’s weakness, with investors appearing to show some relief that it had decided not to pursue its interest in purchasing PostNL following the latter’s rejection of terms, choosing to withdraw rather than raise its offer. Shares in beleaguered oil &amp; gas rig operator Fred Olsen Energy (+134.8%) were also boosted not only by the oil price rise but also the company’s announcement that it is nearing approval from its banks to waive debt covenants which it was on track to breach. BP (+10.9%) also benefited from an environment of oil price strength.</div><div><br>
        Despite the strength in financials, shares in Deutsche Pfandbriefbank (-6.3%) were among the detractors for December. The move was not triggered by any corporate release from the company, and it was a similar story at Las Vegas Sands (-13.0%) and Spark New Zealand (-6.7%), both of which moved lower without any obvious stock-specific catalyst.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><b>Positive contributors to performance included:</b><br>

        <p><strong><span>The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned 1.9%* in November. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index returned -1.8%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned -1.1% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was -0.6%.</span></strong></p>
        <p><strong><span></span></strong><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">UK equity weakness was broad this month as the market digested a host of company trading updates though the small-cap side of the market fared better than large and mid-caps.</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> The Fund outperformed with positive stock movements led by </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Croma Security Solutions </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(+33.7%). The company recorded revenue growth of 16% for the year to end June while pre-tax profit doubled. The growth was driven by Croma Vigilant and Croma Security Divisions which saw 14% and 4% respective top line growth.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">AB Dynamics </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(+29.0%) delivered a strong performance as its share price surged ahead of, and after, the release of its full-year results. The company, which designs, manufactures and supplies advanced testing systems and measurement products to the global automotive industry, reported a 20% increase in revenue and 26% improvement in adjusted operating profit, benefiting from higher customer expenditure for advanced test and measurement equipment. Its outlook was also reassuring, with an order book at record levels which provides visibility into the third quarter of its financial year.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Tracsis </strong></span><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(+16.9%) was another company to report a higher revenue and profit for its full-year. Against tough comparators in 2016, the group managed to deliver a 6% increase in revenue, while pre-tax profit rose 14%. Trading was aided by the integration of Ontrac and SEP which were acquired by Tracsis in 2015/2016.</span></p>
        <p><span class="A2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Cloud communications software provider </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">IMImobile </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(+17.4%) recorded a 48% annual increase in revenue for the six months ending in September and a 3% rise in pre-tax profit. The group’s operations in India and South East Asia made significant progress, with gross profit growing by 84% in the six month period. The company had earlier in the month stated that it expects underlying and gross profit for the full-year to come in ahead of market expectations and announced the acquisition of US-based communications platform provider Sumotext for between US$4.5m and US$6.0m.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">On the other side of the spectrum,</span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> Jaywing </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(-22.1%)</span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">was one of the disappointments after warning that profits for the full-year are expected to be substantially below market expectations. The marketing company has seen clients delay or reduce contracts over the past months due to general economic uncertainty in the UK and squeezes on consumer spending. </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Empresaria Group </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(-19.3%) also stated that its adjusted pre-tax profit for its full year is expected to be below current market expectations. This was a consequence of squeezed margins in its German business, which should impact profit through 2018 as well. In addition to this, weakness in Middle Eastern markets resulted in higher costs.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Away from corporate earnings, defence mini-conglomerate </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Cohort </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(-23.2%)</span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">fell on read-across concerns about UK defence spending after peer Ultra Electronics issued a profit warning highlighting funding issues to defence programmes. However, Cohort issued a statement towards the end of the month confirming that it remains on course to meet the board’s expectations for the full-year, which provided some support to its share price.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Ideagen </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(+24.8%) shares shot higher after announcing a contract win worth an initial US$1.6m with a “global leader in the petrochemical industry”. The company, which supplies compliance-based information management software, stated that US$1.1m of the initial payment is expected to be received in the current year. </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Bango </strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">(+13.1%) announced two new deals, boosting its share price. The mobile payments company expanded its direct carrier billing services to Amazon Prime customers in Japan. It also launched operator-billed payments for Google Play users with 9mobile in Nigeria.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The Fund exited positions in Newmark Securities and Learning Technologies Group. Newmark Security, a provider of access control and workforce management systems, was initially added to the Fund in May 2016 soon after launch. Unfortunately, the company began to experience trading issues, issuing three profit warnings between July 2016 and January 2017, as all three divisions experienced difficulties in their end markets. Repeated profit warnings are one of the main signs that a business is struggling to translate its perceived intellectual capital advantage into real life results, so with little in the way of positive outlook in the 2017 final results the decision was taken to exit the position.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Learning Technologies Group was sold after exceeding the Fund’s market cap limit of £250m. The company’s share price has risen sharply over the autumn starting with the release of interim results in September which showed revenue growth of 68%. The stock was one which had been held in the Fund since launch, delivering a 77% return.</span></p>

The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</span></p>

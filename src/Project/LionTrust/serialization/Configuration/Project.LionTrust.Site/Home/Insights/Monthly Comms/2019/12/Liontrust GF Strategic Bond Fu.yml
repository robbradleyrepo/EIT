        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust GF Strategic Bond Fund returned 0.5%* in US dollar terms in November. For comparison</span></strong><strong><span> </span></strong><strong><span>the average return from the EAA Fund Global Flexible Bond USD Hedged peer group was 0.1%. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span>Market backdrop</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>November was one of those rare occurrences, a normal month in the markets.&nbsp; Post the Federal Reserve cutting rates, and then pausing at the end of October, the markets have taken time to digest the news flow and it was sanguine. A stabilisation in manufacturing activity, best characterised as bumping along the bottom, has helped to keep composite PMIs above the all-important 50 level in most jurisdictions.</span></p>

        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><em>Source: Bloomberg, Liontrust, IHS Marktin.</em></span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Risk markets liked this backdrop, with the S&amp;P500 reaching new record highs and credit spreads grinding tighter over the month. Government bond yields rose; 10-year US Treasuries, UK Gilts and German Bunds all finishing the month around 10 basis points higher. Intra-month volatility was caused by the waxing and waning of hope surrounding the trade deal between the US and China.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>The eagle-eyed reader will have noticed that UK economic growth in the graph above is particularly weak; as well as the impact of the global soft patch, the UK has also suffered from the inventory swings surrounding the Brexit date delays and the ongoing weakness in capital investment that the uncertainty has caused. If it was left to its own devices, the UK economy would be doing pretty well as unemployment is low, albeit many jobs are in the gig sectors, and we are close to full capacity. Furthermore, the UK has managed to get the fiscal deficit under control and has room to increase spending.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>The problem is that the upcoming election on December 12<sup>th</sup> has no positive outcome. This can be seen through examining the possible scenarios.&nbsp; A Conservative majority would probably fast track the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB), but there is a huge risk that they would fail to extend the trade negotiating period by July 2020 and have the UK crash out at the end of 2020. A hung Parliament continues the Brexit impasse, lousy but probably the least worst economic scenario. In the highly unlikely event of a Labour majority the markets would initially panic; but thankfully Labour&rsquo;s ability to deliver even a fraction of what is in their manifesto is questionable at best.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>The UK, once a bastion of predominately logical policy making, has descended into a quagmire of its own making.&nbsp; This led Moody&rsquo;s to change its outlook on the UK&rsquo;s Aa2 rating to negative, in itself not that exciting but the accompanying analysis had some corkers in it in my humble opinion &ldquo;&hellip;<em>the increasing inertia and, at times, paralysis that has characterized the Brexit-era policymaking process has illustrated how the capability and predictability that has traditionally distinguished the UK's institutional framework has diminished</em>.&rdquo; Even though the Conservatives&rsquo; slogan &ldquo;Get Brexit Done&rdquo; is a complete lie due to the huge number of trade deals that need renegotiating if the WAB passes, even if the public perceived Brexit to have been achieved a return to normality is unlikely. As Moody&rsquo;s go on to say &ldquo;&hellip;<em>it would be optimistic to assume that the previously cohesive, predictable approach to legislation and policymaking in the UK will return once Brexit is no longer a contentious issue, however that is achieved. The decline in institutional strength appears to Moody's to be structural in nature and likely to survive Brexit given the deep divisions within society and the country's political landscape.&rdquo;</em> The one thing we can be confident in is that the UK&rsquo;s fiscal purse strings will be loosened regardless of who wins.</span></p>

        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span>Rates</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>The Fund&rsquo;s duration finished November at effectively the same level as it started the month, at around 2.75 years.&nbsp; We continue to believe that government bond markets have been manipulated to be horrendously over-priced.&nbsp; Our neutral duration position would be 4.5 years, significantly shorter than the much-followed Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index which has its own record duration risk at 7.25 years. With our prevailing low beta strategy, where the Fund owns its duration risk is just as important as what duration it has.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>We retain our preference for exposure to the US over Europe and within the US we continue to like Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). In October&rsquo;s report we discussed implementing a tactical curve flattener ahead of the Fed meeting, buying 30-year futures and selling 5-year ones in a duration equivalent amount at a differential of 65 basis points. This was closed out at approximately 55bps; if the 5s30s curve steepens to 80bps we will instigate a longer-term strategic curve flattening position.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Alpha was generated again from tactically taking advantage of the compression between US and Canadian 10-year bonds; this continues to be a good source of small incremental performance, but it all adds up over time. The position in Norwegian debt was taken back up to 0.5 years with an equal duration offset in the German 5-year BOBL future. The 10-year Switzerland against Germany relative value trade implemented in October started to add value in November.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span>Allocation</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>There was effectively no change to the asset allocation over the month. The investment grade credit weighting in the Fund remains c.45%, split between 38% in conventional bonds and 7% in US floating rate notes (FRN).&nbsp; The latter will slowly be rotated into conventional bonds over time as FRNs have done a good job of conserving value, and adding a little extra yield, whilst the short end of the US yield curve was inverted. The Fund retains c.15% exposure to high yield, consisting of 10% in physical bonds and a 5% iTraxx Xover overlay (the European high yield credit default swap index). Our strategic view remains to use any market weakness to take the physical weighting up to 20%, then adjust any CDS index overlays accordingly.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span>Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>There were no exceptional credit outperformers, nor underperformers for that matter, within the Fund during November. Reiterating the first sentence of the backdrop: it was normal month in markets. Performance was very much incremental in nature with a wide selection of bonds adding just a couple of basis points. Trading activity within credit was reasonably low. In the high yield secondary markets we topped up <strong>Allfunds</strong>, the European platform business.&nbsp; We took advantage of a new issue from <strong>Grifols</strong>, the leading European blood plasma products company, to increase the Fund&rsquo;s exposure to this BB-rated credit.&nbsp; The US pharmaceutical company <strong>AbbVie</strong> launched its jumbo investment grade deals for the financing of the acquisition of Allergan; the pricing on these was not overly generous but it did illustrate how cheap the 4.5% 2035 US dollar bonds are. We added to the bonds and their credit spread is already 20 basis points tighter since mid-November.</span></p>

        <p style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.5pt;"><span style="color: #222222;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

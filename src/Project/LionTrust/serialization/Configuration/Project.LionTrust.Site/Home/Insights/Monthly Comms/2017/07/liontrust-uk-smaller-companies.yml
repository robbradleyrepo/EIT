        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned -2.3%* in June, compared with the -2.0% return from the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index.</strong></p>
        <p>Although the UK election result raised the prospect of ongoing political uncertainty and would have done little to support investor sentiment, it is likely that global central bank rhetoric was just as large an influence on the UK equity market’s June fall. A US rate increase – the fourth in its current tightening cycle – and hawkish comments from key individuals at the ECB and Bank of England heightened the focus on the inevitable, but much delayed, ‘normalisation’ of policy. As would be expected, the main impact was on the bond market with US, UK and German government yields all moving higher over the month, particularly at the more policy sensitive short end of the curve. There was also some evidence of spillover into equity markets, with nervousness over the withdrawal of stimulus potentially contributing to the FTSE All-Share’s monthly loss.</p>
        <p>The small-cap end of the UK market, while holding up better then mid and large-caps, was not immune to this weakness. Within the Fund, two of the largest detractors appeared to have succumbed to surprisingly sharp bouts of profit taking.<strong> System1 </strong>(-18.0%) announced 27% revenue growth in the year to £32.8m and a similar increase in profit before tax to £6.2m. The online marketing agency finished the year with net cash of £8.3m allowing it to announce a special dividend of 26.1p per share in addition to a final dividend of 6.4p. <strong>IDOX </strong>(-17.0%) interim results were in-line with its expectations and the level guided towards in a May trading update, but the market appears to have taken the view that it has left itself with ambitious targets for the second half of the year. Interim revenue of £44m (+19% year-on-year) compares with a full-year consensus of almost £100m. In its outlook statement IDOX states it is confident of achieving this outcome due to the visibility of second half revenues, which should include a full contribution from recent acquisitions and an activity uplift from the general election (IDOX’s fiscal year ends 31 October).</p>
        <p><strong>Bango’s</strong> (+35.9%) share price performance in June reflects the significance of the deal it announced during the month: its payment processing services are to be used in Japan to allow mobile phone subscribers on KDDI and NTT DOCOMO networks to charge Amazon purchases to their phone bill.&nbsp; These two carriers account for 75% of mobile subscribers in Japan, a market in which Bango states charging online payments to a phone bill is already a “widely-adopted” method. </p>
        <p>Having released full year result on 31 May, <strong>Kainos Group </strong>(+16.6%) strengthened throughout June. The company, whose services include outsourced IT design and support services to the public sector reported a 9% year-on-year increase in revenues to £94.8m. Its contracted order backlog rose 7% to £76.4m. The company gave upbeat outlook comments, predicting ongoing benefits from the UK government’s digitisation programme.</p>
        <p><strong>James Cropper </strong>(+16.3%), the manufacturer of paper and technical fibre products, grew its adjusted profit before tax by almost a third in the year to 1 April. Its Chairman described the year as a watershed for the group as operational measures resulted in adjusted operating profit margins expanding 30bp to 7.4% and cash conversion improving markedly, allowing the company to now focus its efforts on its long-term growth objectives. </p>
        <p>Intellectual property services group<strong> Murgitroyd</strong> (+15.5%) jumped at the end of the month after a newspaper’s tips column recommended buying the shares to take advantage of 2017’s share price weakness. Shares in the company tumbled in January after stating that results for the year ending 31 May would be behind consensus levels, but the late-June rally allowed it to regain most of that lost ground. </p>
        <p><strong>Sepura</strong> exited the portfolio as Hytera Communications completed its 20p/share acquisition of the company, which found itself in a distressed position having experienced contract delays which threatened its funding position. </p>

The issue of units/shares in Liontrust Funds may be subject to an initial charge, which will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term.

        <p>• Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</p>

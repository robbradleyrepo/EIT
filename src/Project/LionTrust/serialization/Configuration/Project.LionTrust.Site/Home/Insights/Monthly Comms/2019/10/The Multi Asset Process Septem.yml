        <strong><span>September was</span></strong><span> <strong>another busy month on the policy front, with the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank (ECB) both cutting rates and the latter also announcing open-ended quantitative easing (QE) from November, despite many questioning its efficacy. </strong></span><br>
        <p class="Body" style="margin: 12pt 0cm; text-align: left;"><span>This has led to growing calls for fiscal stimulus – either to support or replace monetary – and we wait to see how governments around the world react over the coming months: are they ready to cast austerity aside in a bid to generate growth?</span></p>
        <p class="Body" style="margin: 12pt 0cm; text-align: left;"><span style="border: none; color: #333333;">As widely predicted, the ECB cut its deposit rate to a record lo<span style="border: none;">w -0.5% from -0.4% and pledg<span style="border: none;">ed<span style="border: none;"> to restart bond purchases of </span></span></span></span><span style="border: none; color: #333333;">€</span><span style="border: none; color: #333333;">20 billion a month. With inflation falling, Germany skirting recession and the ongoing US/China trade war sapping confidence, the ECB had all but promised more support to the economy and the <span style="border: none;">only question was how extensive stimulus would be<span style="border: none;">. </span></span></span><span style="border: none; color: #333333;">T</span><span style="border: none; color: #333333;">aken by many as a tacit acknowledgment of how these measures will hit the <span style="border: none;">financial<span style="border: none;"> system, the ECB also eased the terms of its long-term loans to banks and introduced a tiered deposit rate to help these <span style="border: none;">businesses.</span></span></span></span></p>
        <p style="margin: 12pt 0cm; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #333333;">As for the Fed, controversy surrounded a widely trailed and priced in 0.25% cut, with President Trump contributing his usual commentary and growing divisions emerging within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) itself. </span><span style="color: black;">Commentators described this as a hawkish cut, presented in such a way as </span><span>to </span><a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18092112.24390/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDktMTgvZmVkLW1ha2VzLXNlY29uZC1zdHJhaWdodC1yYXRlLWN1dC1zcGxpdHMtb24tZnVydGhlci1hY3Rpb24_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDkxOTE5X0FVVCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0xOTA5MTkmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWF1dGhlcnM/5d3573fb576f2c31ef5a3e1aB413b13fd&amp;data=02|01|david.aitken@liontrust.co.uk|547138ff01264da4248808d73cbb0b4f|4e6acae25b334cf78f09842c7aba2f0f|0|0|637044646364506858&amp;sdata=BZH+iDf4L8aUdx2HginZoP2EIkXlhezQ4O/TUFMZeB0=&amp;reserved=0"><span style="color: black;">douse expectations</span></a><span style="color: black;"></span><span style="color: black;">for future reductions this year: markets continue to price in another 25 basis points reduction by the end of 2019 however, further highlighting the differences between policymakers and investors on prospects for recession in the coming months.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 12pt 0cm; text-align: left;"><span style="color: black;">This latest cut – on top of another in July – was never likely to satisfy a president who appears to feel personally betrayed by Fed chair Jerome Powell, and Trump greeted the announcement with “</span><span style="color: #333333;">No guts," no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator". While seven of the 10 FOMC members voted for the 25bps cut, </span><span style="color: black;">two dissenters argued not to reduce at all and one called for a 0.5% drop. Such disagreement is unusual and obviously makes it difficult for Fed-watchers trying to predict which way policy will go.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 12pt 0cm; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #404040;">Coming finally to the UK, the Bank of England kept rates on hold but said the ‘entrenched uncertainty’ caused by Brexit and trade will keep rates lower for longer and could prompt a cut in short order. Monetary Policy Committee member Michael Saunders said<strong> </strong>that even if the UK avoids no deal,<strong> </strong></span><span style="color: #404040;">rates may still need to be cut, with uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the EU persisting and acting as a kind of "slow puncture" for the economy.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 12pt 0cm; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #404040;">With Parliament prorogued for most of the month, Brexit debate continued at a slightly less manic pace but things erupted again as the Supreme Court judged the suspension illegal and MPs were summoned back to Westminster for a fresh bout of incendiary back and forth.</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 12pt 0cm; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #404040;">In some parts of the press, this was compared to the 1803 </span><span style="color: #222222;">Marbury versus Madison</span><span style="color: #222222;"> in US, a Supreme Court case that established the principle of judicial review, meaning American courts have the power to strike down laws and some government actions that violate the Constitution. </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 12pt 0cm; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #222222;">A month away from the scheduled Brexit date of 31 October, all options still appear to be on the table and it is hard to see what can change to resolve this mess: politicians appear to know what they don’t want but cannot say what they do.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: #333333;">Beyond the usual hum, there was little major movement on the trade picture over the month, with other events</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: #333333;"> taking precedence. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">there was slightly more positive music in the air mid-month – highlighting the alarmingly casual nature of the debate on the US side – and trade principals from America and China will meet in mid-October to continue talks.</span></p>
        <p class="Body" style="margin: 12pt 0cm; text-align: left;"><span style="border: none; color: #333333;">Elsewhere</span><span style="border: none; color: #333333;">,</span><span style="border: none; color: #333333;"> t<span style="border: none;">ensions<span style="border: none;"> rose in the <span style="border: none;">Middle East, with attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia wiping out 5% of global supply an<span style="border: none;">d<span style="border: none;"> caus</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="border: none; color: #333333;">ing</span><span style="border: none; color: #333333;"> the price to spike<span style="border: none;"> 20%. <span style="border: none;">This actually helped the US <span style="border: none;">–<span style="border: none;"> notwithstanding Trump’s </span></span></span></span></span><span style="border: none; color: #333333;">‘</span><span style="border: none; color: #333333;">locked and loaded</span><span style="border: none; color: #333333;">’</span><span style="border: none; color: #333333;"> twitter madness directed towards Iran <span style="border: none;">–<span style="border: none;"> with Chinese oil buyers having to turn to <span style="border: none;">America in the face of <span style="border: none;">reduced Saudi supply.<span style="border: none;"> As we reported last month, Chin<span style="border: none;">a recently imposed a </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="color: #333333;">5% tariff on imports of American oil and recent events will help offset this to some extent although news the former has signed a new $400bn oil deal with Iran are unlikely to please Trump.</span></p>
        <p class="Body" style="margin: 12pt 0cm; text-align: left;"><span style="border: none; color: #333333;">Overall, <span style="border: none;">recent data highlight a fairly muted impact on China from the trade wa<span style="border: none;">r so far, with the country proving able to </span></span></span><span>offset any shocks with timely stimulus and an exchange rate depreciation. With the US economy now slowing more than China, Trump has a large incentive to reach a truce before the start of his re-election campaign – and this supports our ‘too many powerful entities having too much to lose’ view on why recession predictors may be moving too bearish, too early. </span></p>
        <p class="Body" style="margin: 12pt 0cm; text-align: left;"><span>That said, we have all seen how unpredictable this President can be when cornered so it is unwise to assume how he will behave in any circumstances, especially with talk of impeachment gathering pace.</span></p>

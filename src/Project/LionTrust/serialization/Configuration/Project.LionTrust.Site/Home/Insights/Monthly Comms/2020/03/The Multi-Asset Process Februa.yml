        <p><strong><span style="color: black;">The last week of February has overshadowed not just the month but the whole of 2020 so far, with the increasing spread of Coronavirus across the world. This led to markets tumbling and giving up all the gains of the first eight weeks of the year as investors come to terms with the considerable human cost of the virus and the economic disruption of locking down whole cities.</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 21.6pt;"><span style="color: black;">This made the last few days of February<strong> </strong></span><span style="color: black;">the worst week since the 2008 crisis. As would be expected, we saw the usual accompanying surge in gold as a safe haven, rising around 10% so far this year.<br /><br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;">In the first few weeks following the outbreak of Coronavirus in China, the expectation was that the virus would follow a similar path to SARS. We now know this was wrong but there is currently little knowledge of the new virus and no certainty about how long or extensive the outbreak will be. This makes it impossible to know what the economic consequences will be, although the majority view is that there is likely to be a V shaped recovery once the virus is under control.<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />Clarity around the situation is not helped when we live in the age of social media and scare stories spread so quickly: historically, the economic cost of a virus has been more from the associated fear than the disease itself and the language across much of the press of ‘sweeping pandemics’ can only fuel that.<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />As long-term investors, it is vital we do not react with panic or greed. We must assess whether any event is relevant or not, creates investable opportunities or the need to sell, and whether we are too early or too late to invest.<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />Given the clear impact the situation is having – from deserted airports to production lines grinding to a halt – we cannot dismiss this as market noise but, as ever, warn against extrapolating short-term market moves into decisions that affect long-term asset allocation decisions.<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />Like the rest of the market, we maintain a watching brief and can act if necessary, either to protect or capture opportunities. At present, however, we see no reason to make changes to either our tactical asset allocation or holdings across our portfolios.<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />Context is everything in this case: China is home to 1.3 billion, or a fifth of the world’s population, and something like nine million of these people die every year. As for the flu, annual epidemics are estimated to result in three to five million cases of severe illness worldwide and as many as 500,000 deaths.<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />China obviously remains hardest hit as the epicentre of the outbreak and we saw the country’s president</span><strong style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"> </strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">Xi Jinping warn the virus would have a “relatively big impact on the economy and society”. He added it would be short-term and controllable, however, and the government would step up efforts to cushion the blow.<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />Early estimates suggest the outbreak will reduce Chinese growth by 2% in Q1 but only about 0.2% for the full year as catch-up activity occurs and offsetting economic stimulus is implemented – but obviously the longer the situation continues, the greater any impact could eventually prove to be.<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem; letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"><br />Elsewhere, tech companies, whose supply chains have been disrupted, took the brunt of the market drop and this wiped out all the Dow´s and S&amp;P 500´s gains for the year – and we have seen a number of companies reporting lower than expected numbers as either manufacture or demand has suffered.<br /></span><span style="color: black; letter-spacing: -0.1pt; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />Having tied himself to stock market success so tightly, President Trump was quick to reassure investors that the US economy remains in good shape and the market was looking attractive. To be fair, we have also seen a number of economists support that view over the month, albeit primarily in an attempt to warn against any short-term overreaction.<br /></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; letter-spacing: -0.1pt; color: black;"><br />As ever, finding an economic consensus is hard but while there are obviously outliers at both extremes, many suggest uncertainty </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">generated by Coronavirus should not distract from the underlying trends in place at the turn of the year, primarily reflation, manufacturing revival, diminishing trade war uncertainty, and tailwinds from fiscal and monetary policies worldwide. If anything, policy support is likely to increase to counter short-term uncertainty, leading to a sharper bounceback later in the year against a backdrop of depressed expectations.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />Others have highlighted the disparity between ‘Wall Street and Main Street’ – or the market and the consumer for us non-Americans, with data on areas such as consumer spending and housing growing increasingly positive over the last year.<br /></span><span style="color: black; letter-spacing: -0.1pt; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />Looking ahead to the US election with his trademark prescience, Trump said the market would jump ‘thousands of thousands of points’ if he wins a second term later this year and a crash ‘like you never have seen before’ in the event of a Democrat victory. Despite the recent drop-off, the market has surged since Trump’s shock win back in 2016 and he is clearly playing up to nervousness on Wall Street about Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders clamping down on the financial sector.<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />Coronavirus kept Brexit and trade out of the news for much of February but both continue to bubble along in the background, with chlorinated chicken more of a focal point than most people would wish. Both the UK and Europe have signed off their negotiating mandates ahead of initial trade discussions to begin in March, with the EU urging Boris Johnson to keep his promises. It also confirmed warnings from chief negotiator Michel Barnier that Britain must sign up to a level playing field in any free trade agreement and early faultlines are emerging in areas including fishing.<br /></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;"><br />The Government is hoping to achieve the broad outline of an agreement by June with a goal of </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">finalising a deal by September. But if there has been insufficient progress by June, they would “need to decide whether the UK’s attention should move away from negotiations and focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion” – once again, we face a ticking Brexit clock.<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />Johnson is also facing the first signs of pressure from the geographically broad mandate he won in December, with a report highlighting a lost decade in the UK in which life expectancy has stalled for the first time in a century and actually fallen in some of the country’s poorest corners. As we wrote when the Tories unexpectedly won many supposedly left-wing seats in December, these voters will quickly join the ranks of those expecting Johnson to keep his promises.<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />On the trade war front, the Phase One deal came into force over the month and we reiterate previous comments: it is enough to reduce short-term uncertainties (although, of course, that has been replaced by Coronavirus concerns) but fails to address more contentious topics.<br /></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />Until the two countries deal with these fundamental issues, they will remain mired in the Thucydides Trap – a conflict between an existing power challenged by a potential usurper. Trade is a symptom of that deeper conflict, which extends to differences over technology, capital flows, and geopolitics. Despite promises from the US, Phase Two discussions look unlikely to make much progress this year due to American elections and diverted focus of the Chinese authorities towards containing Covid-19.<br /></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;"><br />To finish on Coronavirus, few investors are held in as high esteem as Warren Buffett and </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">he has added to the debate to say current fears should not affect stocks over the longer term. His quote that "You can't predict the market by reading the daily newspaper" is one we should all keep in mind over the coming months, with m</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">arkets </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">likely </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">to remain volatile in line with headlines</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;"> and </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">February’s oscillations setting the pattern</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">.<br /></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />For a comprehensive list of common financial words and terms, see our glossary&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.liontrust.co.uk/benefits-of-investing/guide-financial-words-terms" style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: inherit;">here</a><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">.</span></p>

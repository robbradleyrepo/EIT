        <strong>For investment professionals only</strong>
        <div><strong><br>
        The Liontrust UK Growth Fund returned 3.4%* in&nbsp;</strong><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">December compared with the 5.0% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></div>
        <div><strong><br>
        </strong>
        <div>The UK market finished the year strongly, with expectations for global economic growth improving sufficiently to allow two instances of policy tightening – one immediate and one deferred, from the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank respectively – to be taken in investors’ stride. The Federal Reserve as almost universally expected raised rates by 25bps to 0.75%, and the European Central Bank reduced the scale of its QE programme to €60bn/month while extending it until at least December 2017.<br>
        <br>
        </div>
        <div>The FTSE rallied into the year’s close at 12.30 on 30 December which (when combined with differences in timing of pricing at the start of the month) positively skewed the index performance relative to midday pricing funds by 40+ index points, equivalent to over 1%. The IA UK All Companies sector average return for December was 3.8%.<br>
        <br>
        </div>
        <div>The FTSE’s mining stocks gave back some of their 2016 rally but the oil &amp; gas producers made further ground, helped by OPEC securing the cooperation of non-members such as Russia as it seeks to limit production. The oil price (Brent) added more than 10% to $56.8/barrel and shares in the Fund’s oil majors, BP (+10.9%) and Royal Dutch Shell (+11.1%) both moved higher accordingly.</div>
        <div><br>
        RWS Holdings (+20.9%), the patent translation specialist, released full year results showing that sales increased 28% to £122m and adjusted PBT rose 35%, in-line with the growth rates highlighted in its October trading statement. The profit expansion breaks down to 23% from the acquired CTi business, 2% currency gains and 10% underlying growth. RWS Holdings supplemented these strong financial results for the year to 30 September 2016 with upbeat comments regarding the start of its new year. With the company indicating that performance in the first two months has been very strong and that currency movements have once again been favourable, the shares rallied strongly to new highs in December.<br>
        <br>
        </div>
        <div>It was otherwise a reasonably light month in terms of corporate releases from portfolio holdings. Indivior (-8.2%) issued a statement to accompany an R&amp;D day in New York, but the stock’s presence among the portfolio detractors seems likely to be a function of extended profit-taking after well-received Q3 numbers in November rather than any adverse content in this latest release. The pharmaceutical company announced that it is stepping up investment in pre-commercialisation of its treatment for Opioid Use Disorder in anticipation of FDA approval in Q4 2017.</div>
        <div><br>
        A trading statement from Ultra Electronics (-4.1%) outlined that 2016 revenues would be slightly below its prior guidance. This is due to delays in some export contract awards, which reduces the amount of revenues which can be booked in the 2016 financial year. The largest delayed deal relates to a torpedo defence contract for India, which was won in December 2015 but has yet to be signed.</div>
        <div><br>
        There were no changes to the portfolio’s holdings in December. Following completion of the deal between NEX Group (formerly ICAP) and Tullett Prebon, the latter changed its name to TP ICAP.</div><div><br>&nbsp;
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included:</strong><br>
        RWS Holdings (+20.9%), Brooks Macdonald Group (+13.2%), Spectris (+13.2%), Aggreko (+12.3%) and Royal Dutch Shell (+11.1%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors included:</strong><br>
        Indivior (-8.2%), NEX Group (-7.1%), Statpro Group (-5.8%), Halma (-4.3%) and Ultra Electronics (-4.1%).</p>

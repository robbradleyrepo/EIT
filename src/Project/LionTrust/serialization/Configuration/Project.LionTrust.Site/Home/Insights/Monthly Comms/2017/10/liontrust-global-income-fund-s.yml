        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>The Fund returned -2.6%* in sterling terms in September compared with the -1.3% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</strong></p>
        <p>Significant strength in the pound negatively affected returns from investing in global equities. The MSCI World Index returned 2.3% in local currency terms and -1.8% in sterling terms. Sterling’s strength stemmed from the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee comments that “some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months” if the UK economy continues on its current path. This came as a surprise to the market, causing it to reprice the chance of a UK interest rate increase in the MPC’s next meeting in November. The hawkish tone was echoed in the US, where the Federal Open Market Committee indicated one more interest rate increase in 2017 and three more in 2018. Bond yields in both the UK and US rose, with UK 10-year yields reaching their highest level since February and US 10-year reaching two month highs.</p>
        <p>The rise in bond yields contributed to some weakness within typically high yield sectors such as utilities (-6.3% in sterling terms) and telecoms (-3.0%) while consumer staples (-4.7%) and real estate (-5.1%) both have a reasonable degree of ‘bond-proxy’ constituency which suffered during the month. The Fund’s high yield requirement naturally leads it into some of these sectors; in September overweight positions (v MSCI World Index) in utilities – including <strong>EDP</strong> (-5.6%) and <strong>Endesa</strong> (-10.0%) – and telecoms – including <strong>Bezeq</strong> (-6.8%) and <strong>Spark New Zealand</strong> (-5.3%) – were sources of negative attribution. Additionally, <strong>Vodacom’s </strong>(-18.0%) share price was further depressed by Vodafone’s sale of 90m shares via a placing at R165 a share. The move took Vodafone’s stake in the company below 65%.</p>
        <p>Energy was by far the strongest market sector globally in developed equity markets, and the only one within the MSCI World to post a positive return on the month in sterling terms, +4.6%. Brent oil climbed 10% to reach its highest level in just over two years at US$59.02 a barrel. Oil refineries across the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean were shut as the storms hit the region. Crude prices were further supported after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to turn off an Iraqi oil pipeline following the Kurdish independence referendum vote. The Fund participated in the sector strength via <strong>Fred Olsen Energy</strong> (+40.7%), <strong>Ensign Energy Services</strong> (+9.8%), <strong>Total</strong> (+6.0%) and <strong>Lukoil</strong> (+1.4%).</p>
        <p>Within the materials sector, industrial commodity miners such as <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> (-7.3%) were outperformed by the likes of fertiliser specialist <strong>Potash Corp of Saskatchewan </strong>(+7.0%) and <strong>Navigator </strong>(+10.0%), a pulp and paper manufacturer. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Potash Corp is in the process of merging with Agrium Inc, a deal which is now expected to complete in the fourth quarter – delayed from the third quarter by the Ministry of Commerce in China and the Competition Commission of India’s requirement that Potash Corp dispose of some minority ownerships. Potash has positions in Sinofert Holdings in China, Arab Potash Company (based in Jordan), Israel Chemicals Limited and Chile’s Sociedad Quimica y Minera.</p>
        <p>A strong rally in UK retailers lifted shares in <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> (+10.6%). In addition to the positive economic outlook implied by the Bank of England’s statement, UK retail sales data showing a 2.4% year-on-year (volume) increase in August boosted sentiment. Furthermore, an upgrade to profit guidance from Next was seen as having positive read-across for other high street operators. While still maintaining a very cautious tone overall, Next commented that prospects look “somewhat less challenging than they did six months ago”.</p>
        <p>In a short trading statement,<strong> BGC Partners </strong>(+6.7%) raised its revenue and profit before tax guidance for the third quarter to the “high end of previous range”. The financial and real estate broker now expects revenues of between US$805m and US$820m, representing year-on-year growth of 10%-12%.</p>
        <p><strong>Ashmore Group </strong>(-8.0%) reported results for the year to 30 June which showed 12% growth in AUM to US$58.7bn, with net inflows of US$1.9bn and market growth of US$4.2bn. Given the AUM growth and positive market performance, there had been expectations that adjusted net fee growth might have been greater than the 13% (to US$250m) recorded. The net management fee margin shrunk marginally from 55bps to 52bps due to mandate size effects and the growth of lower-margin strategies. </p>
        <p>The Fund completed another tranche of annual restructuring changes, adding a number of new positions: <strong>Anglo American</strong>, <strong>J.Sainsbury</strong> (UK), <strong>Eutelsat Communication</strong> (France), <strong>Oesterreichische Post</strong> (Austria), <strong>UPM-Kymmene</strong> (Finland) and <strong>Gluskin Sheff &amp; Associates</strong> (Canada).</p>

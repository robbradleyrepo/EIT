        <p>April was a more volatile month for markets than we have seen of late, although to put that in context, the FTSE 100 still ended the period around neutral.</p>
        <p>As has become the norm, politics continued to dominate sentiment and drive market direction, with elections in France and the starting gun fired for the UK going to the polls in June.</p>
        <p>Taking the UK first, the immediate reaction to Theresa May’s announcement was a stronger pound and a weaker stock market – but we continue to stress our policy of ignoring short-term noise as far as possible. Nothing has materially altered the trend in economic growth or inflation and we are not rushing to change direction in portfolios. </p>
        <p>If anything, polls suggest the Conservatives will likely win a larger majority than they have at present so we should perhaps expect a smoother ride in the Brexit negotiations. These are now on hold, or at least moving at a slower pace, until the election is decided so we will have to wait a little longer to find out how much the nation has to pay to access trade and exit the EU. Unless a few more similarly minded political parties gain power across the eurozone, that figure could be a lot higher than we all expect.</p>
        <p>Over the Channel, the first round of the French election, to determine who contested the presidency, again revealed a populace tired of the status quo and seeking fresh political choices.</p>
        <p>With the widely-tipped Republican Party pushed down into third place and President François Hollande’s Socialists fifth with just over 6% of votes, the run-off contest was between former economy minister Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.</p>
        <p>Macron was the favourite and ended up winning comfortably, becoming France’s youngest ruler since Napoleon. Macron is a centrist and his victory will likely support the EU, easing fears of a ‘Frexit’ had Le Pen won power.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, the month also marked 100 days of Donald Trump in the White House and commentators attempting to sift through the controversy to assess his first few months in power.</p>
        <p>Trump is clearly a businessman rather than a politician so is generally seen as pro-business, but I have concerns over the extent to which he will be able to back up his promises. Enacting political change is a laborious process – as his travails to repeal Obamacare have shown – and Trump may find his business life has not left him well equipped for the slow pace of government. In addition, while his corporate tax reform has dominated sentiment, not all of his likely policies will be so business-friendly. In my view, his protectionist agenda will only hurt the US consumer and economy.</p>
        <p>Looking around global markets, nothing looks screamingly good value at present. Emerging markets and Asia have underperformed developed over recent years and there is clearly room for some equalisation, whether Western markets drop off or Eastern catch up.</p>
        <p>One thing we can say about financial markets is that they rarely go up in a straight line and we continue to expect intermittent corrections in the 5-10% region. We saw that happen before Christmas in Asia and Emerging Markets, where fears around US protectionism and changing trade agreements under Trump saw both fall off and gave us an opportunity to top up weightings.&nbsp;</p>
        There remain areas where we are keen to add to our positions – Europe, Asia and GEMs – but not at current prices and we are happy to stay patient and wait for more opportunities when markets correct. Following the herd in investment is very rarely the best thing to do.<br><br>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust Strategic Bond Fund returned -7.9%* in sterling terms in March, compared with the -7.6%<span style="color: red;"> </span>average return from the IA Sterling Strategic Bond sector. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Market backdrop</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Unprecedented is a word getting plenty of use in the current environment and with good reason given around 20% of the global population currently lives under effective lockdown conditions. With the equivalent of many years’ worth of government policy developments crammed into a month, we will aim to distil the salient points for bond markets.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Starting on monetary policy, the simplest way to picture this is that it mainly addresses the supply side shock, making sure companies and the financial system can access liquidity. In this regard access to cash is more important than the interest rate charged on said cash. Taking the US as an example, about US$550bn of committed facilities out of a US$2.5 trillion total have already been drawn down to provide companies with a liquidity buffer.</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The speed and depth of central bankers’ response to the situation has been far greater than anyone expected, clearly understanding we are in emergency territory. We have seen something of an alphabet soup of polices emerge and, without going through each one in detail, this is basically central banks throwing everything at the problem.</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Most important is the fact QE (quantitative easing) is back and in style; the US effectively committed to QE infinity and the phrase ‘whatever it takes’ was in constant use around the world over recent weeks. All the major Western countries are moving towards some kind of TARP (Troubled Assets Relief Program) but for markets as a whole rather than just the banks, as it was back in 2008/9. The Federal Reserve’s announcement that it was prepared to support the corporate bond market helped provide a much-needed fillip to a beleaguered asset class. Even with this, March 2020 was the worst month on record for corporate bond returns; before the Fed’s actions market returns were worse than September and October 2008 added together!</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Fiscal policy is the big weightlifter when it comes to the demand side of the equation and focuses on keeping companies afloat and employment going and looking after society’s most vulnerable. We have seen an invocation of crisis language and this gives governments the ability to push towards crisis levels of funding, running with large budget deficits and basically writing off 2020 as a bad economic experience while keeping companies going and employment up.</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The US fiscal deficit is already at 4.5% but there is nothing to stop that climbing as high as 10%. The US$2 trillion package that passed through Congress in March may well be followed by an infrastructure bill, particularly given the 10 million rise in unemployment in the last two weeks of the month. Western economies are socialising the crisis costs and running up deficits, kicking it into the long grass for future generations’ tax revenues to deal with – and economically, that is exactly the right thing to do. The hard part is getting the money to the right areas and we would expect more fiscal developments.</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The measures that have been taken will not prevent a very deep depression occurring. However, they should ensure that the worst of the downturn is cushioned for the majority of people. An economic recovery will take time to materialise, the longevity of the crisis depending on the nature of the exit strategies from the lockdowns. The key point for us is that the system will survive and, even though there is enormous uncertainty, this is an investible market for selective risk assets.</span><br /></p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Rates</strong><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Simply owning duration during in March would not have offset any mark-to-market losses from credit parts of any bond portfolios. Rates exposure had to be taken in the correct places. In hindsight, we should have owned more duration beta in the Fund than 2.75 years</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><sup>†</sup></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">, but the majority of the investments were in the right places. By major geography the US was the clear bond market leader with 10-year yields rallying over 50 basis points; the UK only saw yields fall by 5 basis points and in Germany they actually rose 10 basis points. Government bond yield curves steepened as short rates were cut and longer-dated bonds are more exposed to increased supply fears and reflationary government policies.</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">New Zealand started QE and its bonds rallied; we trimmed exposure post the rally and have also taken off the relative short versus Australia. A standout performer on the month was Norway where rate cuts and the weak oil price combined to create a large rally; profits were taken with the position completely exited.</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">During the turmoil government bond liquidity decreased in nearly everything except on the run US Treasuries. Liquidity got better but still needs to improve further. Until then the majority of the rates alpha trades in the Fund will be implemented using liquid government bond futures. During March, the Fund made money a couple of times being short Canada versus the US. A long France against Germany position created a rapid profit and then the position was reset at an attractive level.</span><br /></p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Allocation</strong><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The largest change to the Fund we made during the crisis was to add to high yield, taking the weighting to 30%. Some of this was through physical holdings, but most was using the iTraxx Xover CDS (Credit Default Swap) Index for implementation liquidity reasons. We used the averaging in approach, the first few purchases are offside and the latter ones in the money, but this is a strategic investment. We have not pushed toward the Fund’s 40% limit as there is likely to be continued volatility to exploit throughout the crisis.</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Investment grade exposure is now in the 50-55% area. We have slightly increased the spread duration of the holdings and tilted the portfolio more towards US dollar denominated credit where a greater valuation opportunity has arisen, caused by market wide fund outflows.</span><br /></p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Selection</strong><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Unlike in previous crises there was nowhere to hide, all credit spreads widened regardless of sector. The good news is the Fund had very little exposure to the areas that suffered the hardest impact. The Fund had no additional tier 1 (AT1), the most subordinated part of the bank capital structure where many bonds were down 45 points at their worst; furthermore we also did not own any RT1, the insurance sector equivalent. The Fund started the month with no corporate hybrids, we did purchase an </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">AT&amp;T</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> bond after it had fallen 7 points; this is the only corporate hybrid in the Fund.</span><br /></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">By sector the Fund had no exposure to airlines, airports, cruise lines, re-insurers and many other tainted areas. We have 1% in energy and one retailer; the latter is </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">CVS</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> which is actually hiring 50,000 extra people at the moment. On the leisure side we did own a small position in </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Center Parcs</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">, this was sold at a cost of approximately 3 basis points.<br /></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />The stock picking methodology of focusing on businesses that are sustainable over the long term has left the Fund well placed to benefit from the recovery in spreads and helped to avoid the worst of the downside.</span></p><p /><p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Discrete 12 month performance to last quarter end (%)**:</span></strong></p>

Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

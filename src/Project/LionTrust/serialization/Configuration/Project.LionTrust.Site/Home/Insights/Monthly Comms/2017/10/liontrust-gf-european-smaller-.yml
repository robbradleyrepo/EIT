        <p><strong>The Fund’s A5 share class returned 3.7%* in euro terms in September (A4 share class 3.7%). This compares with the 4.5% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index.</strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; background: white;">The month saw renewed hawkish sentiment from central banks in the UK and US. In its September policy meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee indicated one more interest rate increase in 2017 and three more in 2018. Somewhat more surprisingly, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee stated that “some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months” if the UK economy continues on its current path. The market rapidly repriced the possibility of near-term interest rate hikes in the US and UK, causing bond yields to rise and the pound to reach its highest level in four months. </p>
        <p>Market leadership in September came from cyclical sectors, with energy (+8.6%), industrials (+5.6%) and consumer discretionary sectors (+5.5%) displaying strong gains. More typically defensive areas lagged; real estate (-0.9%), utility (-0.4%) and consumer staples (+0.4%) posted the poorest performance. The energy sector’s performance was aided by a 10% rise in oil prices. Oil refineries across the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean were shut as the storms hit the region while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to turn off an Iraqi oil pipeline following the Kurdish independence referendum vote. </p>
        <p>It was a story of solid monthly gains for most of the Fund’s holdings, reflecting a benign market backdrop. The Fund participated strongly in the energy sector rally via UK oil services company <strong>Hunting </strong>(+23.2%) and Swedish oil producer <strong>Tethys Oil </strong>(+9.3%).</p>
        <p>UK residential property investor <strong>Grainger</strong> (+9.8%) released a full year trading update for the period to 30 September. The company has recently increased its focus on the opportunity in the private rented sector (PRS) and has built a secured PRS pipeline of £517m. It has a further £341m in pre-pipeline planning stages which should go a long way towards meeting the £850m secured pipeline target announced 20 months ago. The company saw 3.7% like-for-like rental growth across its portfolio (in the 11 months to 31 August) and expects to book a modest improvement in capital values in the second half of the year following 2.1% growth in the first half.</p>
        <p>Cash management and transit provider <strong>Loomis </strong>(+9.7%) upgraded its financial guidance within a statement issued to coincide with a Capital Markets Day. The company is now targeting SEK24bn in revenue by 2021, an operating margin of 12%-14% between 2018 and 2021 and a dividend payout ratio of 40%-60%.</p>
        <p><strong>Liberbank </strong>(-23.4%) was the most significant detractor from performance during the month. The Spanish lender proposed a €500m capital increase to bolster its financial reserves as it aims to continue reducing its bad loan ratio. This follows the collapse of peer Banco Popular. The capital increase is expected to take place in November. Its share price partially recovered after regulators banned short-selling of the stock through to the end of November 2017.</p>
        <p>Relatively few other portfolio holdings ended the month in negative territory. Among these, <strong>Lenzing </strong>(-7.4%) dropped on concerns about the impact of price weakness in its Viscose brand while <strong>Oriflame </strong>(-4.3%) traded lower during a month in which consumer staples companies were out of favour. Overall, however, the Fund’s low exposure to consumer staples relative to the market was a source of positive attribution. </p>

        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Hunting (+23.2%), Inficon (+15.2%) and WH Smith (+9.3%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Liberbank (-23.4%), Lenzing (-7.4%) and Oriflame Holding (-4.3%).</p>

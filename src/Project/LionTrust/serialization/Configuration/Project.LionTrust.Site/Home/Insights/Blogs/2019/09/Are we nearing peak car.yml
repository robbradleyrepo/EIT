        <p><strong>As sustainable investors, we focus on the biggest&nbsp;</strong><strong>issues of our time, hunt for companies that can solve them and invest in the opportunities of maximum impact for maximum returns – and one of the key issues of this era is transport.</strong></p>
        <div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: black;">Short-term problems in our auto industry are well known but we look beyond the profit warnings of 2018 and trade war tweets of 2019 to the underlying drivers. Emissions controls have been an issue for decades but we believe something more fundamental is at work: the problem is not should we buy a diesel, petrol, hybrid or full electric but rather whether to own a car at all.</span></div>
        <p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 2.45pt;"><span style="color: black;"><br>
        Evidence for the underlying theme abounds but we are particularly interested in Marchetti's constant. This analysis from a World Bank economist spanned from ancient Greece to modern-day Berlin and concluded that humans will travel around 30 minutes to their place of work and 30 minutes back. Anything beyond that, over thousands of years of evidence, has proved unsustainable.</span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 2.45pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 2.45pt;"><span style="color: black;">As we all know, 30 minutes to get anywhere in a modern city is ambitious and we need to recognise how fast urbanisation is happening: globally, half the world’s population already live in cities and the UN estimates more than two thirds of us will do so by 2050. </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 2.45pt;"><span style="color: black;"><br>
        The congestion that so many of us face on a daily basis is not only unsustainable from a human tolerance perspective, it is also an economic waste. A 2013 study from the Centre for Economics and Business Research estimated the fuel costs, unnecessary expense and lost time from city congestion cost the US, UK, France and Germany 0.8% of GDP a year.</span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 2.45pt;"><span style="color: black;"><br>
        Where, then, is the opportunity? If driving is too energy and time intensive and dangerous, what is the solution? This is driving the notion of ‘peak car’ and we feel analysts are missing what the public is increasingly realising – driving is no longer fun or convenient. We have gone from half of Americans obtaining their driving licenses as soon as they were able in the 1990s to just over a quarter doing so in 2017. We are moving beyond car ownership to new mobility solutions. </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 2.45pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 2.45pt;"><span style="color: black;">The next global car-free day is 22 September so keep an eye out for people championing everything from cycle lanes to railroads and even changing where you work to bring it within micro scooter range. </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 2.45pt;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 2.45pt;"><span style="color: black;">We are investing in a wide range of solutions, from battery recycling that works to close the loop across electrified transport solutions to braking systems that will encourage high speed rail. In future articles, we will talk about our holdings in Knorr-Bremse, Umicore and Trainline and how we believe they can make money for our clients by having positive impacts on our transport system. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5rem;"><br>Sustainable investment is often about freedom: to eat without consuming harmful chemicals, to build and manufacture without warming the planet, to shop for clothes without contributing to modern slavery or plastics in our oceans. In transport, while the freedom of the open road is vanishing fast, the freedom to move is just beginning.</span><br></p>

                    <br>
                    Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The majority of the Liontrust Sustainable Future Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Some of these funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and has a concentrated portfolio of securities, there is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund’s share price. Liontrust SF Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Corporate Bond Fund, Liontrust SF Cautious Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Defensive Managed Fund and Liontrust Monthly Income Bond Fund invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions, it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the bonds held by these funds. Mentioned above five funds can also invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interests rates move or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions.<br>

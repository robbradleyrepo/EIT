        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>The Fund returned 0.3%* in sterling terms in February compared with the 2.6% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</strong></span></p>
        <p>A combination of strong macroeconomic data and some expectations of greater Trumpflation policy substance drove another month of rises for global equity markets. The MSCI World gained 3.9% in sterling terms, closing the month near to an all-time high.</p>
        <p>After months of being dominated by political events and related news flow, global stock markets were to a greater extent influenced by fundamental factors following a busy corporate results season and the release of macro data. The US monthly data set included stronger-than-expected jobs, consumer confidence and PMI readings. Europe saw a strong UK Q4 GDP reading and higher-than-expected French and German PMI data, while Chinese trade data was surprisingly strong. This fundamental focus may be a short-lived trend as forthcoming elections in Germany, the Netherlands and France &ndash; as well as the resumption of Greek debt bailout talks &ndash; remain very much in investors&rsquo; thoughts. </p>
        <p>Trump was still a factor in equity markets, with anticipation of &ldquo;phenomenal&rdquo; tax reform measures mounting ahead of his address during a joint session of Congress. Although his speech at the end of the month failed to deliver on the desired details it was widely agreed that his tone was more &lsquo;presidential&rsquo; than previous comments. </p>
        <p>The strength in US economic data fuelled expectations of a March rate rise from the US Federal Reserve: the futures market&rsquo;s implied probability of a hike rising from 31% to 52%. Minutes from the FOMC&rsquo;s January meeting revealed its willingness to consider an increase &ldquo;fairly soon&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Despite the rise in rate expectations &ndash; usually supportive of the strength in the financials sector &ndash; there was a reversal in the prevailing trend of cyclical outperformance versus defensives, with financials&rsquo; 3.5% return lagging that of the wider index. &nbsp;Given the Fund&rsquo;s high yield hurdle, February&rsquo;s rotation into defensive low-yield stocks presented a difficult backdrop. For example, the Fund has low allocations to healthcare and consumer staples which rallied 6.9% and 5.5% respectively in February. Although Opec indicated that its cuts had reduced the oil market surplus quicker than it expected, the energy sector lagged the wider market&rsquo;s rise, adding 0.7%. Materials (+0.3%) was another area to underperform. </p>
        <p>On a number of occasions we have commented on the sensitivity of the Fund&rsquo;s relative performance given its low weighting to the US. With the MSCI USA Index returning more than double the monthly performance of the MSCI World ex-USA Index, the Fund&rsquo;s low exposure relative to the index and peers was again a short-term headwind. </p>
        <p>February&rsquo;s strongest performer in the portfolio was Genworth MI Canada (+16.9%), whose Q4 results came in higher than analysts&rsquo; expectations, with EPS of C$1.14 comparing with consensus forecast of C$0.96. Its loss ratio in the quarter was 18%, down 5 points. Net premiums earned over 2016 rose 9% yoy to C$638m.</p>
        <p>Having begun to strengthen after a January trading update, shares in Ashmore Group (+14.8%) rose following the release of interim results. As flagged in the trading statement, AUM had fallen over the six months but were around 5% higher than 12 months previously. The interim period saw a US$0.7bn net outflow, which represents a significant trend improvement from the US$1.8bn and US$5.7bn net outflows seen in the preceding two six-month periods. The company commented that although the US election result in Q4 2016 interrupted the improving sentiment seen towards emerging market assets, this effect was short-lived and investors have returned to the asset class in 2017.</p>
        <p>Shares in NN Group lost 10% after it announced Q4 numbers which included a 12.6% yoy rise in its operating result (from ongoing business) to &euro;282m. Its full year 2016 operating result declined due to the previously announced negative impact from storms on its non-life insurance business. </p>
        <p>The materials sector lagged in February and, although steel prices edged up in the month, Severstal (-9.3%) was one of those caught up in the weakness. Ensign Energy Services (-11.0%) was also affected by sector weakness, and not helped by a broker downgrade on concerns over the demand outlook for its drilling rigs. </p>
        <p>During the month we sold the positions in Cleanaway, Chunghwa Telecom and RR Donnelley, stocks which no longer meet the yield requirement of the Fund.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Genworth MI Canada (+16.9%), Ashmore Group (+14.8%) and Seagate Technology (+8.0%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>NN Group (-10.8%), Ensign Energy Services (-11.0%) and Severstal (-9.3%).</p>

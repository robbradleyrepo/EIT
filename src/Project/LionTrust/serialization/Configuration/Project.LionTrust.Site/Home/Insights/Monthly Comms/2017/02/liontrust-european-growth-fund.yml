        <b>For investment professionals only<br><br>
        The Fund returned -6.0%* in sterling terms in November, compared with the -5.4% return from the MSCI Europe ex-UK index.<br></b><br>
        Despite speculation that a Trump win would send markets into a heightened state of uncertainty and trigger a sharp reversal, the President-Elect’s pro-growth, fiscal stimulus acceptance speech was the catalyst for a strong rally in markets, led by the S&amp;P 500 Index which reached a new high of 2213 on 25 November and ended the month 3.6% higher (US dollar terms).<br><br>
        European markets failed to follow suit, registering a broadly flat performance as Brexit news flow and Italian referendum uncertainty cast a shadow over the region. There was a bounce in the pound, breaking a pattern of depreciation seen since the Brexit vote outcome in June. Sterling ended the month up 2.2% versus the US dollar and 5.9% versus the euro, resulting in a negative monthly performance from the European market in sterling terms.<br><br>
        As equity markets reached new highs in some regions, debt markets continued their aggressive sell-off. The yield on the US 10 year Treasury rose 56bps to 2.38%, as the probability of a US rate rise at the FOMC’s December meeting reached 100% according to Bloomberg’s analysis of implied probability in futures markets. In Europe, the yield on the German 10 year bund rose a further 11bps while UK gilt yields rose 17bps.<br><br>
        Financials was the strongest performing sector in the European equity market in sterling terms, down 2.8%, taking some relative strength from the significant rally in bond yields. This was followed by energy (-3.0%) and materials (-3.5%). The former was boosted on the last day of the month as OPEC announced it had – contrary to recent speculation – reached an agreement amongst its members to cut production. This prompted a 9% rally in Brent crude. The commodities price rally was partly fuelled by the anticipation of Trump’s infrastructure spending initiatives. The weakest sectors during the month included utilities (-13.3%), perhaps reflecting the sector’s bond proxy characteristics, followed by telecom services (-10.1%) and consumer staples (-9.6%).<br><br>
        The Fund’s portfolio mirrored the market’s pattern of returns, with financials – UBS Group (+9.6%), NN Group (+4.5%), ING Groep (+1.3%) – and energy/materials – Tethys Oil (+2.8%), Vopak (+2.4%) and Norsk Hydro (+2.9%) – prominent among the top contributors while utilities and consumer staples de-rated: Oriflame (-31.9%), Royal Unibrew (-17.5%), Red Electrica (-16.4%) and Swedish Match (-12.6%).<br><br>
        In terms of stock-specific catalysts to share price moves, Actelion’s (+30.0%) emergence as a takeover target was one of the most significant. With speculation mounting, Actelion on 25 November confirmed that it had received an approach from Johnson &amp; Johnson concerning a possible transaction.<br><br>
        On the downside, shares in Swedish beauty product retailer Oriflame underperformed following the release of Q3 numbers. The company reported strong quarterly earnings but management commented that it had seen more volatility in trading so far in Q4. Following the shares’ substantial rally this year, these comments prompted some significant profit taking in the stock.<br>
        <br>
        Vestas Wind Systems (-19.4%) was another significant portfolio detractor due to Trump’s campaign comments that he would not support renewable energy (and therefore possibly remove production tax credits post 2020). The shares recouped some losses in the latter stages of the month as investors took some reassurance from the high proportion – c.70% – of revenues which the company generates outside of the US, and the increasing (recurring) revenue stream from maintenance contracts, following strong order intake in recent years. Shares in Banco Popolare (-30.1%) continued to weaken ahead of the Italian referendum on constitutional reform.<br><br><b>

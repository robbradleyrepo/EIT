        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust GF Special Situations Fund returned -1.6%* in January, compared with the -3.3% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The mid-month signing of a &lsquo;phase one&rsquo; trade agreement between the US and China gave investors some cause for cheer at the start of 2020, but sentiment swiftly soured as an outbreak of coronavirus caused increasing international concern. The virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, showed signs of spreading rapidly, raising the prospect of a significant human cost as well as substantial economic ramifications from containment measures. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The potential negative impact on global growth was reflected in falls of the price of oil and other commodities. Brent crude prices dropped 12% over January. As a result, the oil &amp; gas and basic materials sectors of the FTSE All-Share were its weakest, falling 8.2% and 7.5% respectively. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">The Fund holds no miners so avoided some of the weaker stocks, but <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> (-10.7%), <strong>Plexus Holdings</strong> (-9.5%), <strong>John Wood Group</strong> (-5.6%) and <strong>BP</strong> (-3.2%) did see losses. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>Craneware </span></strong></span><span>(-20.8%) </span><span>was the heaviest faller in the portfolio.<strong> </strong>Year-on-year sales growth in the first half of the</span><span> </span><span>financial year to 30 June 2020 was boosted to 30% due to completion on a number of contracts that had been delayed from the prior year. While the healthcare software provider stated that the number of hospitals renewing contracts was significantly higher year-on-year, the loss of a large customer has dragged &ldquo;customer renewals by dollar value&rdquo; down to 74%, well below its historic range of 85% - 115%. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>An interim trading update from <strong>Dotdigital</strong> (+19.0%) was better received. In the six months to </span><span>31 December the company saw 15% growth in revenue to &pound;23.1m following a 14% increase in average revenue per user to &pound;999/month. The software-as-a-service provider of omnichannel marketing automation expects profits for the period to be in line with market expectations. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>There was also positive news from <strong>Savills </strong>(+9.6%) as a year-end trading update confirmed a rebound in confidence among UK real estate investors following December&rsquo;s general election result. The boost to investor sentiment helped its UK commercial and residential business lines perform well, which &ndash; together with strong performances from its US division and investment management operations &ndash; it cites as pushing 2019 results towards the upper end of its expectations. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Recruitment company <strong>PageGroup</strong> (-12.7%) is seeing less positive trends. Macroeconomic and political uncertainty were cited when reporting a 0.4% decline in Q4 gross profit. Large markets including China, the UK and France were among the worst affected, leading to a reduction in fee-earner headcount of 54. PageGroup commented that the tough Q4 trading conditions are anticipated to continue in the majority of regions. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The cyclicality of </span><span>metrology specialist <strong>Renishaw&rsquo;s </strong>(+5.5%) end markets during a period of weak global growth has been evident through recent sets of results. In January it announced more of the same, with a 14% decline in interim revenue to &pound;259m. Renishaw&rsquo;s shares firmed slightly over the month, suggesting that a soft macro outlook is now factored into consensus expectations following downgrades in the second half of 2019. As well as weaker demand in the machine tool sector and trade tensions between the US and China, Renishaw&rsquo;s year-on-year comparison is made less favourable by some large orders from Asian consumer electronic manufacturers last year that failed to repeat. The company has reduced costs &ndash; headcount dropping by 170 to 4,870 &ndash; but still has substantial operation leverage that saw profits drop from &pound;60m to &pound;14m. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>A December trading update from <strong>Unilever</strong> (+4.2%) had warned that it would miss its medium-term sales target range of 3% - 5%. Full year 2019 results released at the end of January confirmed underlying sales growth of 2.9% during 2019, driven by small improvements in both volume and price. There was better news in terms of profitability as its underlying operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 19.1%. The consumer goods giant also announced a strategic review of its global tea business, which includes the Lipton and PG Tips brands, following subdued demand for traditional black tea in developed markets. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Shares in <strong>TI Fluid Systems</strong> (-10.9%) have recovered strongly since an August setback which was triggered by a weak outlook for the global automotive market within its interim results. A solid Q3 trading update released in November offered some reassurance and helped fuel a rally through to the end of the year. A full year trading update in January now appears to have triggered some profit taking. The manufacturer of highly engineered automotive fluid storage maintained guidance for 2019 revenues of &euro;3.4bn, outgrowing global light vehicle production by more than 2%.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Interim results from <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> (-10.9%) </span><span>revealed a 10% year-on-year fall in net new business to &pound;2.3bn in the period to 31 December 2019 as political uncertainty and Woodford fund suspensions undermined investor confidence. The company nevertheless increased assets under administration by 6% to &pound;105bn over the six months. Profit before tax rose by 12% to &pound;171m. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>Integrafin</span></strong></span><span> (+12.5%) announced that funds under direction for its Transact investment wrap platform increased by 4% over Q4 2019 to a total of &pound;39.3bn.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p style="background: white;"><strong><span style="color: #222222;">Key Risks&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: black;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital.&nbsp;Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest primarily in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the&nbsp;GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the&nbsp;UK Growth Fund and will be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</span></p>

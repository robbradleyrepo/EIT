        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>The Fund’s A5 share class returned 5.1%* in euro terms in April (A4 share class 5.0%). This compares with the 4.8% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index.</strong></span></p>
        <p>After months of anticipation, European equities and the euro received a shot in the arm from the first round of the French presidential election. Centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen ended as the two front runners ahead of the second round of voting in May. Markets had been concerned about growing support for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon and the prospect of a far-left versus far-right battle. However, Macron’s victory in the first round has provided a clear favourite. The euro appreciated by 1.4% in trade-weighted terms between the result’s announcement and the end of the month. However, the euro fell versus the pound (-0.8%), which itself jumped after UK Prime Minister May called a surprise snap election.</p>
        <p>The financials sector was among those in the MSCI Europe index to react positively to the result (+2.3% in euro terms), boosted by the perception of a more certain path for the French economy and eurozone under Macron. A ‘risk-on’ reaction saw other cyclical sectors perform strongly, including industrials (+3.9%) and consumer discretionary (+3.4%).</p>
        <p>The worst performing sectors in the MSCI Europe index were telecoms (-2.9%), energy (-2.6%) and utilities (-2.0%). The Fund has no exposure to the latter two sectors. While it does own a selection of energy names, only Fred Olsen Energy (-29.5%) was affected by the negative sector backdrop, as the likes of Soco International (+9.4%) and Tethys Oil (+6.4%) made gains. Tullow Oil (+6.7%) also generated a positive total return in a month in which it completed a US$750m rights issue in order to pay down debt. It also issued an AGM trading statement which reported in-line production from both its West African and European portfolios and maintained guidance for the full-year. </p>
        <p>JD Sports Fashion Group (+17.0%) was one of the biggest contributors to the Fund’s performance after the company posted a record adjusted pre-tax profit of £245m for the year to 28 January. The sports fashion division generated an adjusted operating profit increase of 50%, while the outdoor business delivered its first ever operating profit.</p>
        <p>Swiss dentistry company Straumann Holding (+12.5%) announced strong first quarter results. Group revenue was up 20% year-on-year and it achieved double-digit organic growth across all divisions. The group also raised full-year guidance for organic growth to a low-double digit percentage range from a high single-digit range it had previously predicted in its full-year results</p>
        <p>Swedish table-top product supplier Duni (-5.1%) reported an increase in net sales for the first quarter of 2017 after making a weak start to the new year. However, the company warned that it sees a short-term challenge in the form of raw material price trends.</p>
        <p>In keeping with the Cashflow Solution investment process, April saw the initial implementation of changes to the portfolio resulting from our annual review of companies’ reports and accounts. New positions were opened in Sydbank, Hexpol, Schouw &amp; Co and Inficon Holding. Swedish Match was removed from the portfolio.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>JD Sports Fashion (+17.4%), BGEO Group (+13.5%) and Straumann Holdings (+12.6%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Fred Olsen Energy (-29.5%), Duni (-5.1%) and Banco BPM (-3.9%)</p>

        <p>• Past performance is not a guide to future performance. • Do remember that the value of an investment and the income from it can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.&nbsp;• Some of the Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team invest in smaller companies. These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. • The European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio which could mean that it will be volatile when compared to its benchmark. • The Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.</p>

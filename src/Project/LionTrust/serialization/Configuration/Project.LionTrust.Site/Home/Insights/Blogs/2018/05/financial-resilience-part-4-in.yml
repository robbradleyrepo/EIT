        <p><em>This article was first published by Alliance Trust Investments on 7 March 2016.</em></p>
        <p><strong>In the final part of our four part series on financial resilience we talk about insurance. Insurance can spread the risk faced by an individual or a corporation amongst many other factors. In markets where there is high penetration of insurance, companies are prone to poor practices when trying to maintain high returns.</strong></p>
        <p>Insurance can spread the risk faced by an individual or a corporation amongst many other factors. The benefits of good insurance are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides a safety net (at a small cost)&nbsp; to mitigate: death in family; medical emergencies; material loss from natural disasters </li>
            <li>Supplements state social protection for individuals</li>
            <li>Mitigates financial impact of catastrophes for corporations</li>
            <li>Lowers the capital a firm needs to operate</li>
            <li>Increases investment by reducing uncertainty&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Provides a price for risk
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In markets where there is high penetration of insurance, companies are prone to poor practices when trying to maintain high returns. Particularly in areas where pricing is transparent and easily comparable, like car insurance.</p>
        <strong>Does insurance increase prosperity; or prosperity increase insurance?&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        </strong>
        Probably a bit of both<br>
        <br>
        <p><img alt="GDP/Non-life insurance " src="-/media/DD803883B6BE4D4ABBF4980A471D5609.ashx?h=298&amp;w=438&amp;hash=4E2536A030C4266C2BA796954AE5EBF21938C91D&amp;hash=4E2536A030C4266C2BA796954AE5EBF21938C91D" style="height: 298px; width: 438px;"></p>
        Source: Lloyds &ndash; Global Underinsurance research October 2012 &ndash; page 41<br>
        <br>
        According to Lloyds a 1% increase in insurance penetration leads to (or is correlated with) a 13% reduction in uninsured losses; a 2% increase in investment (as % of GDP); and a $6000 per capita increase.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Catastrophe Insurance<br>
        <br>
        </strong>
        Another proposed benefit of insurance is that in the event of a catastrophe the speed of payment of compensation is more rapid and the taxpayer does not have to foot the bill.<br>

        Two different catastrophes and levels of insurance: China and the UK.<br>

        <strong>
        &nbsp;</strong><br>
        <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Life Insurance Companies<br>
        <br>
        </strong>Life insurance demand comes from individuals setting aside a portion of their income to get a degree of compensation for them or their families in the event of death, injury, illness, or loss of employment. They also administer defined contribution pensions and provide annuities on the capital sum on retirement. Growth is correlated with population size and age, affluence, and the role of the state (where the welfare state is in retreat; so the need for private life insurance grows).<br>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Where should we expect the most growth?<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="Premiums as % of GDP" src="-/media/780C92D7EB9F4032BFCB8DE525767A04.ashx?h=284&amp;w=454&amp;hash=374A60927A42C31167D1B167CC49179D759159D0&amp;hash=374A60927A42C31167D1B167CC49179D759159D0" style="height: 284px; width: 454px;"><br>
        </strong><strong></strong><br>
        Growth in life and non-life premiums has reached a plateau in developing markets &ndash; the strongest growth was from the 60s to the 90s. In emerging markets there is still reason to expect strong growth.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Global Insurance Market: Historic shares and forecasts<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="Life vs non-life premiums" src="-/media/5FE30DB7A6974DEF81DD87C8FC519505.ashx?h=282&amp;w=454&amp;hash=F302A46E19F4FE0B38A94392A9F087C33B8E28DB&amp;hash=F302A46E19F4FE0B38A94392A9F087C33B8E28DB" style="height: 282px; width: 454px;"><br>
        </strong><strong></strong><br>
        Swiss Re estimate annual growth rates in premiums of 8% in emerging markets over the next ten years, compared to 2.3% in developed markets - led by Asia at 10%. Our view is that ageing populations will boost demand for private life insurance and high government debt levels of governments will lead to cuts in social security systems.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>How do insurance companies make profits?<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="Insurance company structure" src="-/media/E6C0DE8819124BCB8E89065760C1DB3F.ashx?h=357&amp;w=450&amp;hash=8D76A145E0E0181D7F11EC28E7D5E2A0DD54A156&amp;hash=8D76A145E0E0181D7F11EC28E7D5E2A0DD54A156" style="height: 357px; width: 450px;"></strong><br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        With non-life insurance there is only a short lag between premiums coming in and claims going out. For life companies this can be much longer. For these investment strategies, guarantees (if any) and underwriting are vital elements for a successful strategy. In UK Life much of the investment risk has been shifted onto the client (no guarantees), leaving the insurer&rsquo;s role as more administrative.<br>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Potential winners<br>
        <br>
        </strong>We prefer companies exposed to strong growth in the number of clients and the amount they insure &ndash; either through: population growth, growth in middle class, or market share gains. We do not like companies dependent on selling spurious insurance; buying market share through high acquisition costs; nor companies offering products with guarantees; or those with weak capital structures. Companies that accurately and conservatively price risk are also preferred. We believe that Prudential and Legal &amp; General stand out as long-term winners from attractive structural trends and as such, are held across the SF fund range.<br>

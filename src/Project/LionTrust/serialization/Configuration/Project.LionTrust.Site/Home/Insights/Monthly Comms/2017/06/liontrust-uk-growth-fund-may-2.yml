        <p style="text-align: right;"><strong></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Liontrust UK Growth Fund returned 4.0%* in May compared with the 4.4% return from the FTSE All-Share Index. </strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">London-listed stocks continued their strong run in May, with the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 both notching new all-time highs. However, it was the large cap index which outperformed (+4.9% vs +2.2%). Developments ahead of the UK General Election contributed to the sterling weakness (-2.8% in trade weighted terms) and large-cap outperformance as opinion polls showed Theresa May’s lead over Jeremy Corbyn narrowing throughout the month. The FTSE Small Cap and AIM All-Share indices returned 2.6% and 3.1% respectively. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Fund’s underweight position in large caps relative to the FTSE All-Share Index was therefore a headwind in May. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Defensive areas of the FTSE All-Share led the gains with telecoms (+10.6%), utilities (+7.9%) and health care (+7.8%) the best sector performers. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Fund’s exposure to this trend was limited by its underweight positions in telecoms and utilities but it did benefit via its health care exposure as both AstraZeneca (+12.9%) and GlaxoSmithKline (+11.2%) recorded strong gains. Having both featured in the Fund’s negative contributors after the release of Q1 numbers last month, shares in both companies came strongly back into favour. AstraZeneca’s rally was aided by good news relating to trials on its <em>Imfinzi </em>drug. The treatment was found to be statistically significant and clinically meaningful in improving progression-free survival when used by lung cancer patients for whom surgery is not an option.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Both of the Fund’s large-cap household goods stocks – Reckitt Benckiser (+11.6%) and Unilever (+9.9%) – made good gains in May, with their steady growth profiles seeing them benefit from the investor rotation into defensives. The two companies are reviewing their portfolio of brands, looking for opportunities to make value enhancing deals. Unilever’s strategic review concluded that its Spreads business would be sold, but it has sought to accelerate growth in its core Foods &amp; Refreshment division – buying Colombia’s Quala and launching a joint venture in Myanmar. Reckitt Benckiser in April announced that its French’s Food business was for sale, as it looked to reshuffle its portfolio ahead of completion of the US$18bn acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Neither of the two smaller companies to feature in May’s top contributors issued material newsflow in May, but both Brooks Macdonald (+14.6%) and RWS Holdings (+12.4%) rerated strongly through the month. In April Brooks Macdonald had announced the appointment of a new CEO as well as details of 6.5% quarterly growth in funds under management to £9.9bn, as inflows and investment performance made broadly even contributions. Shares in RWS Holdings have been rallying since an early April trading statement which announced 37% year-on-year growth in adjusted interim profit before tax, following strong growth in patent translation demand particularly for its higher margin subscription based services.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Petrofac (-53.3%) was the Fund’s biggest detractor after the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched an investigation into its use of Unaoil as a consultant for its operations in Kazakhstan. Petrofac subsequently suspended its COO, who then resigned from the Board. Other stocks in the sector traded lower on concerns that the investigation might widen. John Wood Group (-5.8%) and Amec Foster Wheeler (-7.2%) – in the process of a business combination – were among those affected. While the SFO investigation represents a serious risk for Petrofac investors, we feel it is one that has been more than adequately discounted through a halving of its equity value and we added to the position. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">PayPoint (-7.0%) released full year results that painted a picture of a company in transition. Net revenues were flat year-on-year at £124m, but stripping out the impact of non-core businesses sold (Online &amp; Mobile) its retail net revenue grew 6% to £118m. PayPoint provides a payments and parcel delivery network operating from over 40,000 convenience stores. Following its refocus, it is looking to develop a new payment service offering which will compensate for an anticipated decline in customers using cash to pay utility bills over the counter.</span></p>

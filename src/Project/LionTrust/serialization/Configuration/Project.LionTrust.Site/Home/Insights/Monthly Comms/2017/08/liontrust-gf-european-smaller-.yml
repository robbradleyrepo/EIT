        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund’s A5 share class returned -0.9%* in euro terms in July (A4 share class -0.9%). This compares with the 1.1% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index.</strong></p>
        <p>The MSCI Europe Small Cap Index’s performance in euro terms was hampered slightly by a rise in the euro, which reached its highest level in trade weighted terms since late 2014. The currency’s appreciation continued to be driven by the market’s expectation that the European Central Bank will soon start tapering its substantial monetary support to the eurozone economy. ECB President Mario Draghi tried to maintain a dovish message in his press conference following the Bank’s decision to leave its policy unchanged, but failed to deter further euro appreciation. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the dollar sank as faith in the ‘Trump trade’ further waned following the defeat of the president’s “skinny” healthcare reform in the Senate. Additionally, US economic data has been soft. Low inflation in particular has been a cause for concern and the Federal Reserve noted in its July policy statement that it is “monitoring inflation developments closely”. US stock indices, however, continued to push onto new record highs due to a broadly positive Q2 earnings season. </p>
        <p>In the commodity space, oil prices rebounded strongly as US inventories data showed much larger declines than had been forecast. Brent oil rose 9.9% during the month to US$52.7 a barrel. Copper prices also rose to their highest level in two years following reports of a ban on imported scrap metal in China, while iron-ore prices touched a three-month high. This led to strength in the materials sector (+2.7%), which was the biggest sector gainer in the MSCI Europe Index. The Fund’s holdings in the sector include <strong>Evraz </strong>(+12.7%) and <strong>Ferrexpo </strong>(+12.6%), which both benefited from the rise in metal prices. Other strong sector performers were financials (+2.6%), telecoms (+2.4%) and energy (+1.5%). The biggest sector fallers were health care (-4.5%), consumer staples (-2.9%) and industrials (-2.3%). </p>
        <p>However, sector movements were not a major attribution factor in July, with the Fund’s underperformance against the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index largely driven by some adverse stock specific news. One of the biggest detractors from performance was <strong>Bergman &amp; Beving</strong> which delivered a total return of -18.8% after it issued a disappointing trading update for the three months to the end of June. The Swedish industrial consumables and components supplier’s revenue fell 9% year-on-year when adjusted for the number of trading days, while EBITA declined 30% as a result of ongoing restructuring investment. Polymers group <strong>Hexpol </strong>(-9.3%) reported an 11% annual increase in second quarter operating profit but still fell short of the market consensus, triggering weakness in its shares. </p>
        <p>Outdoor advertising company <strong>APG SGA’s</strong> (-9.9%) interim results showed a 2.9% fall in first half revenue and a 37% fall in headline EBITDA. <strong>Eurocell </strong>(-15.1%) shares encountered weakness ahead of interim results scheduled for release in August.</p>
        <p><strong>Inficon Holding</strong> (+7.6%) was among the best performers in the Fund after reporting strong second quarter numbers. The Swiss company, which provides instruments for gas analysis, measurement and control, reported a 24% annual rise in second quarter revenue and a 56% increase in operating income. As a result, the company lifted its sales guidance for 2017 to at least US$340m from US$320m and operating margin outlook to 18% from 17%. &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Skandiabanken (+14.8%), Evraz (+12.7%) and Ferrexpo (+12.6%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Bergman &amp; Beving (-18.8%), Eurocell (-15.1%) and APG SGA (-9.9%).</p>

        <div><em>This article was first published by Alliance Trust Investments on 4 April 2016.<br></em></div><p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br>Simon Clements, investment manager, looks how technological change is a constant feature of the modern digital age, providing a wealth of investment opportunities. Here he explores a few of these including smart buildings and smart cars.</strong><br></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Technological change is a constant feature of the modern digital age. Disruptive technologies permeate every facet of our lives, often improving our quality of life and making what was previously considered impossible, possible.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In the 1970’s the idea that every family would have a computer in their home seemed both fanciful and unnecessary. 40 years on and the advent of smart phones means that most of us have access to a computer all day, every day. From horse and cart to car; VHS to DVD’s; CDs to iPods and iPhones – technology has progressively reshaped our every-day lives.</span></p>
        <div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The ATI Sustainable Future process is thematically driven and our focus is on the changes that are happening within the global economy. We look for and invest in technologies that improve people’s quality of life, make the economy more efficient, safer and more resilient and are attractively valued. </span></div>
        <div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;</span></div>
        <div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Many of these technologies are disruptive, and as investors, our ability to identify long-term technology winners from inception is crucial. The adoption of new technologies is almost always underestimated as is the impact on the challenged, incumbent technologies. Adoption curves for disruptive technologies can often accelerate exponentially, and true disruption is very difficult to predict. </span></div>
        <div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;</span></div>
        <div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">An example, cited by academic and leading commentator on the role of technology as disruptor Dr Tony Seba, tells the story of telecommunications giant AT&amp;T hiring consulting firm McKinsey in the mid 1980’s to forecast the adoption of mobile phones over the next 15 years. McKinsey’s prediction was 900,000 subscribers, but by 2000 some 109 million people were using mobile phones. McKinsey’s estimate was off by a factor of 120.<br>
        </span></div>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br>
        History shows that experts consistently fail to understand the exponential nature of disruptive technology adoption. So, as investors, we need to continually identify key technological changes and understand that once adoption begins, it can accelerate very quickly. Identifying new trends is the cornerstone of our process, and we are seeing some exciting opportunities in the current emerging group of disruptive technologies, such as energy storage, smart buildings and smart cars.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Immediate applications </strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">A key emerging disruptive technology combines cost competitive solar power and battery storage technology. Even if we ignore the carbon benefits of solar power in the energy grid, the ability for homes to generate enough power for their own needs, and for a cost which is competitive and does not increase over a 20 year time period, is an enticing prospect. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Encouragingly, obstacles standing in the way of this goal are increasingly disappearing, with costs of solar technology falling. The economics and realities of the finite fossil fuel industry look increasingly less attractive as the production costs of renewables fall and economies of scale increase. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Another current limitation of solar energy is intermittency; the sun shines during the middle of the day but we consume most of our power in the evenings and in the morning. However, the solution to this problem may be around the corner in the form of ever improving battery technology. Home batteries could allow us to store energy during the day, and to use it as we need it in the evening. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Tesla’s ‘Power Wall’ - a home battery that charges using electricity generated from solar panels during the day (when utility rates are low) and powers your home in the evening – is an example of a disruptive technology that has the potential to revolutionise home energy usage. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In our portfolios we invest in a number of firms that will benefit from the changes to solar technology and the advances in energy storage, such as SunPower, a specialist in the design and manufacture of energy saving and environmental protection products like solar cells; Manz, which supplies and services integrated production lines for panel displays, thin film solar modules, and lithium-ion batteries, and IP Group whose portfolio includes CleanTech companies such as CeresPower, who develop fuel cell technology. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Smart buildings </strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Another disruptive technology that may well be at a tipping point is the network technology behind smart homes and buildings, which is emerging as the next big potential change to everyday life. Just as smart phones took a semi-conductor chip and transformed our mobile phones into an intelligent hand held computer, semi-conductor chips that are integrated into everyday appliances like home refrigerators, office air conditioning and lighting units can transform the way we use energy and cut costs for consumers and businesses alike. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">This technology will allow air conditioning systems to connect with lighting systems, for example, to ensure they harmoniously adjust to various different factors such as human occupancy and sunlight levels to ensure no energy is being wasted. Meanwhile your fridge will soon be able to connect to your home energy system to optimise when it draws power to avoid peak energy costs. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In our portfolios we hold companies that are driving this smart revolution, from Acuity Brands in lighting, Daikin in air conditioning technology, Google and Schneider which design the controls, to Arm Holdings which pioneers widespread adoption of semiconductors in a host of everyday appliances. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Smart cars </strong></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The automobile industry has been in the news recently, after the Volkswagen scandal exposed the fault lines in an industry that is struggling to cope with the challenges of disruptive technologies. The irony is that cars were a disruptive technology themselves when they displaced the horse and cart. The industry has struggled to adapt to increasingly stringent environmental standards, and the demand for smaller, more efficient vehicles. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The car of the future will be more like a computer on wheels than a complex mechanical motor, and technological advances here are moving very quickly. Again, Tesla is leading the way and has proven that electric cars can make&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">better performance vehicles than those with traditional combustion engines – at the same time as being five times more efficient. We currently don’t invest in Tesla as we think it is overvalued, however we invest in the companies that are enabling the change that Tesla has pioneered, such as Linear Technology and NXP semi conductors.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> Autonomous driving technology, which only a few years ago was considered science fiction, is rapidly evolving and the possibilities are very interesting. These so called ‘self-driven’ cars will almost certainly use roads and infrastructure more efficiently, meaning fewer accidents and more time to work and relax – rather than drive. These technological advances are happening now, and the traditional car manufacturers are scrambling to adapt. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Cars being made today are already increasing their electronic and software content significantly. Around 70% of the value of a Tesla car consists of software and electronics – with the engine forming a much smaller component than for traditional competitors, whose vehicles are typically only around 30% software and electronics. However, this figure is moving up and we hold a number of companies set to benefit from this growing electronic content in the auto industry such as NXP, Infineon, Hella and Linear Technologies. These companies are the key players in the technology industry in areas such as the semi-conductor chips which process information in and around the car. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">What is most interesting is that many of these disruptive technologies are interrelated. As electric vehicles become more popular, demand for solar technology increases, driving down its cost. Meanwhile, advances in battery technology reduces costs for both home batteries and electric vehicles, and also feed into smart homes and smart buildings. In the ATI Sustainable Future team we believe we are on the cusp of something revolutionary, and our process has built portfolios that are set to benefit from this change.</span></p>

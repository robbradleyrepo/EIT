        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust GF Special Situations Fund C3 share class returned -2.5% (C1 class -2.6%) in June compared with the -2.5% return from the FTSE All-Share Index*.</strong></p>
        <p>The UK stockmarket’s reaction to the general election result was all-in-all fairly muted. May’s failure to secure, let alone strengthen, a Conservative majority initially led sterling to fall and large-caps to outperform their mid-cap peers in a pattern which is familiar from last year’s referendum reaction. Both of these moves had moderated by month-end though, with little to pick between the FTSE 100 Index’s -2.9% total return and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -2.4% from the mid-cap FTSE 250 Index [the FTSE Small-Cap was, however, an outlier with a -0.8% return] and the pound barely any lower in trade-weighted terms.</p>
        <p>Although May’s lead was seen as narrowing throughout May and June due to a lacklustre campaign, the election result was still a surprise. Polling firms have had a rough ride over the last couple of years, but one that got it right was portfolio holding <strong>YouGov </strong>(+9.8%)<strong> </strong>whose new ‘Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification (MRP)’ technique had predicted a hung parliament. </p>
        <p>It was central bank rhetoric which transpired to be a larger influence on investor sentiment in June, with a US rate increase – the fourth in its current tightening cycle – and hawkish comments from key individuals at the ECB and Bank of England heightening focus on the inevitable, but much delayed, ‘normalisation’ of policy. As would be expected, the main impact was on the bond market with US, UK and German government yields all moving higher over the month. There was also some evidence of spillover into equity markets, with nervousness over the withdrawal of stimulus potentially contributing to the FTSE All-Share’s monthly loss, weakness in which ‘bond-proxy’ areas such as utilities (-8.0%), tobacco (-5.3%) and telecoms (-3.1%) featured. Other notable soft areas included oil &amp; gas (-4.2%) as the spot oil price slipped below $45 a barrel (Brent) mid-month and retail sectors (general retailers -8.1%) following a profit warning from DFS Furniture which was seen as having negative read-across for other high street operators. DFS referred to a footfall reduction which it believed to be market-wide, stemming from customer uncertainty relating to the election and the macro environment in general. The Fund has no exposure to traditional high street retailers although the share price fall in <strong>Domino’s Pizza Group</strong> (-7.3%), which came without any corresponding corporate releases, may have been affected by the consumer spending outlook. </p>
        <p>It is precisely in such uncertain environments that our conviction in the Economic Advantage is so valuable. In our view, an uncertain political and macro outlook only strengthens the appeal of good-quality companies with barriers to competition, pricing power and the ability to sustain earnings.</p>
        <p>The portfolio’s largest detractor in June was <strong>IDOX </strong>(-17.0%), whose interim results prompted a surprisingly sharp bout of profit-taking. Although its financials for the first half were in-line with its expectations and the level guided towards in a May trading update, the market appears to have taken the view that it’s left itself with ambitious targets for the second half of the year. Interim revenue of £44m (+19% year-on-year) compares with a full-year consensus of almost £100m. In its outlook statement IDOX stated it is confident of achieving this outcome due to the visibility of second half revenues, which should include a full contribution from recent acquisitions and an activity uplift from the general election (IDOX’s fiscal year ends 31 October).</p>
        <p>Shares in <strong>Wood Group </strong>(-10.5%) also fell, tracking the oil price lower. The weakness was compounded by an interim trading update in which it stated that its first half performance has been weaker than anticipated. The downturn in its core oil &amp; gas market is no surprise, and the company had been anticipating a reduction in margins due to a tougher pricing environment, but the scale of these issues appears to have been underestimated. While Wood Group states it is now more cautious on the full year outlook, it does expect the second half to be stronger than the first. </p>
        <p><strong>Bango’s</strong> (+35.9%) share price performance in June reflects the significance of the deal it announced during the month: its payment processing services are to be used in Japan to allow mobile phone subscribers on KDDI and NTT DOCOMO networks to charge Amazon purchases to their phone bill.&nbsp; These two carriers account for 75% of mobile subscribers in Japan, a market in which Bango states charging online payments to a phone bill is already a “widely-adopted” method. </p>
        <p><strong>Aggreko </strong>(+6.5%) announced a bolt-on acquisition in Indonesia in the form of Kerta Bumni Teknindo (KBT), a power rental company for which it will pay a maximum consideration of US$32.8m, in line with the company’s net asset value. KBT is renting out 200MW of diesel and gas power to Indonesian utility PLN, a customer which Aggreko already supplies with 140MW, and the deal should further cement this relationship. </p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p>Other large portfolio movers included: <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown </strong>(-6.9%), which<strong> </strong>slipped on the release of an FCA paper which included a recommendation that retail investors are offered cheaper asset management products and services; <strong>Gamma Communication </strong>(+7.9%)<strong> </strong>which rallied ahead of a trading update scheduled for July;<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>GlobalData</strong> (+10.5%), whose shares moved higher despite a lack of newsflow.</p>
        <p><strong>Sepura</strong> exited the portfolio as Hytera Communications completed its 20p/share acquisition of the company, which found itself in a distressed position having experienced contract delays which threatened its funding position. </p>
        <p>New positions were initiated in <strong>Kainos Group </strong>and <strong>Caretech</strong>.</p>
        <p>Kainos Group is an independent digital technology company with three separate strands to its business. The largest of these is the provision of outsourced IT design and support services to the public sector, benefitting heavily from the UK government’s agenda to digitise public services. The firm also provides mobile-enabled healthcare solutions to the NHS via its Evolve software, while its third leg is involved in providing implementation and support to fast-growing US ERP software provider Workday as its only European boutique partner. Possessing strong know-how in software development, Kainos has used internal resources to develop IP-rich software products which are increasingly profitable and also provide the company with a sticky data-driven distribution network advantage.</p>
        <p>Caretech is a provider of care homes to “high acuity” patients on behalf of local authority and health services commissioners throughout the UK. Such individuals – either adults suffering from learning disabilities and mental health problems, or children and young people with behavioural disorders or requiring foster care – typically stay in care homes for a much longer period of time than elderly patients (10 years on average), providing annuity-type revenue streams to the group. Caretech’s physical distribution network represents a key Economic Advantage intangible asset. Caretech’s portfolio of 450 care homes would be very difficult for a competitor to replicate from scratch, while the company has also built up a valuable network of vitally important relationships with local authorities in different regions.</p>

The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</p>

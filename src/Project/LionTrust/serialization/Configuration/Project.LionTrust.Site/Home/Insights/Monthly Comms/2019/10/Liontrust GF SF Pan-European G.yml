        <p><strong><span style="color: black;">The Fund returned 1.8% over the quarter under</span></strong><strong><span style="color: black;">performing the </span></strong><strong><span style="color: black;">MSCI Europe Index’s 2.6%*</span></strong><strong><span style="color: black;">.</span></strong></p>
        <p class="Body" style="margin: 12pt 0cm;"><span>We saw another busy quarter on the policy front, with the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank (ECB) both cutting rates – twice in the case of the former – and the latter also announcing open-ended quantitative easing (QE) from November. </span></p>
        <p class="Body" style="margin: 12pt 0cm;"><span style="padding: 0cm; border: 1pt none windowtext; color: #333333;">With inflation falling, Germany skirting recession and the ongoing US/China trade war sapping confidence, the ECB had all but promised more support to the economy and the only question was how extensive stimulus would be. Meanwhile, taken by many as a tacit acknowledgment of how these measures will hit the financial system, the ECB also eased the terms of its long-term loans to banks and introduced a tiered deposit rate to help these businesses.</span></p>
        <p class="Body" style="margin: 12pt 0cm;"><span class="s2" style="color: black;">Concerns facing markets – in the shape of Brexit and trade wars – continue to be significant but they are also largely political and could be swiftly resolved. This makes positioning difficult and we maintain our balanced approach, seeking companies with sustainability-based growth that can weather these short-term storms and also deliver value for the decades to come.</span></p>
        <p><span>We look for businesses that enable the shift towards a global economy that is more efficient, provides a higher quality of life and is more resilient. We believe these high-quality companies, with structural growth and strong fundamentals, will outperform over the long term.</span></p>
        <p><span class="s2" style="color: black;">As&nbsp;ever, the majority of our performance against this backdrop came from stock</span><span style="color: black;"> selection, with a broad selection of holdings contributing to returns.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">ASML was once again among our stronger performers as the company released a solid set of second-quarter numbers in July, with sales </span><span style="color: black;">within guidance and gross margins above guidance, helped by improved </span><span class="e24kjd" style="color: black;">Extreme ultraviolet lithography</span><span style="color: black;"> (EUV) manufacturing results. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">We believe commercialisation of this technology will deliver a wide range of significant positive impacts and financial value for ASML. </span><span style="color: black;">Despite ongoing concerns around the economic outlook and semiconductor cycle, the company is now delivering these machines on a commercial scale and reconfirmed its positive growth outlook for 2019.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Elsewhere, Roche was a solid contributor, with the company once again extending its offer to buy US gene therapy specialist Spark Therapeutics. As regulators continue to scrutinise the deal, analysts believe the long delay may be down to competition concerns about what the combined entity would mean for the hemophilia market.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Roche is a key beneficiary of our <em>Enabling Innovation in healthcare </em>theme and reinforcing that, the company has the highest number of Breakthrough Therapy designations in the industry. Such progress continues to help alleviate market concerns about pressure from potential erosion to its core oncology franchises</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Familiar names such as Puma and Cellnex also posted strong results, as did recent additions Orsted and Verbund plus leading data centre player Interxion, with this latter three all exposed to our theme of reducing carbon emissions.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">With Interxion, the technology industry emits high levels of carbon so more efficient data centres are vital to efforts to reduce emissions. The business announced Q2 results in August, outlining revenue growth of 14% and </span><span style="color: black;">incremental investments in Frankfurt, Paris, Marseille and Stockholm in response to growing customer demand and orders.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Among the detractors, </span><span style="color: black;">Abcam had a weaker period despite solid results. Over the period, the company released ambitious growth targets for 2024 and while management has a strong track record of hitting such goals, the market was not expecting Abcam to invest so much in the near term to achieve them. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">In contrast, we believe the company is making sensible steps to take advantage of current opportunities and continue to grow its strong position in this field. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">SAP also saw its share price drop off despite announcing </span><span>double-digit growth in total revenue, cloud revenue and non-IFRS operating income for Q2. Commenting on the results, CFP LUKA Mucic said this performance is remarkable considering the margin headwinds from the company’s latest acquisition and recent short-term trade-related uncertainty in Asia. </span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">Prudential, meanwhile, saw its share price stabilise in September but had a tough quarter overall although issues continue to stack up in the short term, with a £24m fine for transparency around open market annuities and the High Court rejecting proposals to transfer £12bn of annuity business to insurer Rothesay Life. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;"><br>
        As we have stressed in previous reviews,</span><span style="color: black;"> irrespective of any short-term price volatility, we see solid long-term prospects for the company, with low levels of insurance penetration in China, appropriate products and an excellent management.</span></p>

        <strong><span>Key Risks </span></strong></span></strong><span><br>
        <br>
        <strong><span>Past performance is not a guide to future performance.</span></strong> Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The majority of the Liontrust Sustainable Future Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Some of these funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well-regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and has a concentrated portfolio of securities, there is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund’s share price. Liontrust SF Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Corporate Bond Fund, Liontrust SF Cautious Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Defensive Managed Fund and Liontrust Monthly Income Bond Fund invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions, it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the bonds held by these funds. Mentioned above five funds can also invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interests rates move or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions.<br>

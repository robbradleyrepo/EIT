        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span></span><strong><span>The Liontrust Strategic Bond Fund returned 0.5%* in sterling terms in July, compared with the 1.0% average return from the IA Sterling Strategic Bond sector. </span></strong></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span>As bond markets rallied during the month, we stuck with our low beta approach – only taking risks in what we believe to be the correct areas. During periods when rates move lower, we look to alpha generation to compensate for the Fund presently running with a low beta. Since inception on 8 May 2018, the Fund is up 6.1, ahead of the 5.8% sector average despite running with less rates market risk during the period. </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>Market backdrop </span></strong></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span>July can best be characterised as containing more of the same. Manufacturing data has generally been weak, albeit not universally, and services and consumption are chugging along nicely. Trade wars rumble on with the market oscillating between optimism at resolution and frustration at political posturing. No matter what the scenario is, a stray tweet from President Trump can always make things worse; the end of the month saw the re-escalation of tensions with China as another tariff ultimatum was issued. </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span>The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in over 10 years and the ECB strongly signalled monetary easing for its September policy meeting. </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span>We continue to believe that central banks are over-reacting to the manufacturing slowdown; inflation is only a little lower than the modal 2% target - it is running at 1.9%! Consumption is strong and employment is still growing. We believe that contagion from manufacturing to the all-important services sector will occur but only enough to trim exuberance as opposed to creating a recession. Our central thesis would be challenged if unemployment rises or wage inflation rapidly falls. On the fiscal side the removal of the threat of sequestration takes out a potential 0.7% GDP tail event from the US economy this year. The consensus forecast for the US economy is for 2.4% growth in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020; the respective numbers for real global growth are both 2.7%. </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span>The proverbial “insurance cuts” to interest rates are happening but they are not needed. It is instructive to reflect on the two periods in the 1990s when 75 basis points of insurance cuts occurred. The US curve shape (3 month versus 10 year) was similar in the 1990s and is actually a smidgeon flatter now. More pertinently, the ISM survey was much worse in the 1990s before the Federal Reserve cut rates. Its actions can therefore be seen as front running a problem rather than waiting for an actual downturn to happen; or that insurance is being purchased sooner. We find it concerning that monetary policy is being used to deal with the political issues caused by Trump and his tariffs. </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span>When the Federal Reserve cuts most other central banks feel empowered, or indeed obliged, to follow. This is not just about the co-ordinated global slowdown in trade, there is also a decent amount of currency manipulation at stake. Even with this monetary largesse the rates markets are set up for disappointment if policymakers don’t deliver, or economic Armageddon doesn’t appear! Having US$15 trillion of negatively yielding bonds cannot be a rational long term state for markets to be in. At the time of writing even the 30 year German bond has a negative yield! </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span>On the subject of weak currencies, sterling continues to be the safety valve for the UK’s woes. Threats of a no-deal Brexit from the new Prime Minister Johnson have impacted confidence in financial markets and the corporate sector. Our best estimate is that a general election will be called before the October 31</span><span>st </span><span>Brexit date. </span><span style="color: #00af50;">UK duration should be avoided, </span><span>but some of the UK banks’ bonds are starting to look a little more interesting after recent spread widening. </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>Rates </span></strong></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span>The Fund continues with the strategy of running with low duration exposure at approximately 2.5 years. US 10 year yields were actually almost flat over July, but have strongly rallied in early August. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) have been recent laggards. Offsetting this, the Fund has generated alpha from being short Canadian government bond futures relative to the US. Profits have been taken on a quarter of a year’s equivalent New Zealand duration, which now leaves a small pair versus Australia as the Fund’s remaining antipodean exposure. </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span>In Europe, the Fund has bought back into Norwegian sovereign debt relative to German 5 year futures (BOBLs). Within Germany, the Fund has made a good return from a ‘5s10s curve flattener’ position (long 10 year debt relative to 5s). Finally, on the isolating pure alpha front, </span><span style="color: #00af50;">the Fund has entered its first ever box trade</span><span>; we are long French 30 year debt relative to Germany and the inverse at the 10 year tenor. </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>Allocation </span></strong></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span>There has been almost no change to the Fund’s asset allocation over the month. The investment grade weighting remains at about 45% gross through a combination of conventional bonds and floating rate notes; offsetting some of this risk is a low beta 6% US investment grade hedge (CDX IG). The high yield weighting is just below 10%; if the risk correction caused by Trump’s tariff threat continues then we will look to add to the asset class. As a reminder we view 20% as a long term neutral high yield weighting so would be buying from an underweight starting position. </span></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>Selection </span></strong></p>
        <p class="Default" style="text-align: left;"><span>After the spread compression of the last few months there are fewer opportunities within credit. A couple of comparative laggards offer decent relative value so the Fund purchased a subordinated bond in US dollars in State Street during July. Shorter-dated Pershing Square bonds were topped up, as were floating rate notes issued by Amgen and CVS. Within the high yield sphere, Ardagh called the US dollar bond that the Fund owns and we have added to the sterling bond in the secondary market to replace some exposure. If the current spread wobble continues, more opportunities will inevitably arise. For obvious reasons the UK banks’ bonds have suffered significant spread widening and we are considering a little risk addition in this area.</span></p>

        <br>
        <strong>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. </strong>Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.<br>

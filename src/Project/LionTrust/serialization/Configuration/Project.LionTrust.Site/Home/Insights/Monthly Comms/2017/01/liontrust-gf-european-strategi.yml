        <strong>For investment professionals only</strong><br />
        <br />
        The Fund returned -2.2%* in euro terms in November, compared with the 1.1% return from the MSCI Europe Index and the 1.1% return of the HFRX Equity Hedge EUR Index. Net exposure at month end was c.45%.<br />
        <br />
        Having performed strongly in recent months, November saw some reversal in the long and short books which contributed -0.9% and -0.7% respectively&dagger;. Stock specific news flow drove performance with the long book&rsquo;s strongest stocks in recent months giving back some gains, while short book performance was held back by some corporate takeover news flow.<br />
        <br />
        The month was dominated by the US Presidential election and the subsequent shock result that saw Donald Trump defy the polls and win relatively convincingly. Despite earlier speculation that a Trump win would send markets into a heightened state of uncertainty and trigger a sharp reversal, the President-Elect&rsquo;s pro-growth, fiscal stimulus acceptance speech was the catalyst for a strong rally in markets, led by the S&amp;P 500 Index which reached a new high of 2213 on 25 November and ended the month 3.6% higher. European markets followed suit albeit in not such strong fashion, with the MSCI Europe index finishing the month just over 1% higher as Brexit news flow and Italian referendum uncertainty cast a shadow over the region.<br />
        <br />
        Similar to last month, financials was the strongest performing sector in the European market, up 4.8% in euro terms and reflecting the recent significant rally in bond yields. This was followed by energy, rising 4.4%, and materials up 4.2%. The former was boosted on the last day of the month as OPEC announced it had &ndash; contrary to recent speculation &ndash; reached an agreement amongst its members to cut production. This prompted a 9% rally in Brent crude. The weakest sectors during the month included utilities (-6.8%), perhaps reflecting the sector&rsquo;s bond proxy characteristics, followed by telecom services (-4.1%) and consumer staples (-3.4%).&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        As equity markets reached new highs in some regions, debt markets continued their aggressive sell-off. The yield on US 10 year Treasury bills rose 56bps to 2.38%, as the probability of a US rate rise at the FOMC&rsquo;s December meeting reached 100% according to Bloomberg&rsquo;s analysis of implied probability in futures markets.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        In Europe, the yield on the German 10 year bund rose a further 11bps while UK gilt yields rose 17bps. There was some cessation in the depreciation of sterling seen since the Brexit vote outcome in June. In fact, the pound ended the month up 2.2% versus the US dollar and up 5.9% versus the euro.<br />
        <br />
        In the Fund&rsquo;s long book, the strongest performer was Reliance Steel, the US based steel manufacturer and distributor. The shares rose 23% as the steel sector was viewed to be a potential key beneficiary of Trump&rsquo;s infrastructure spending initiatives and possible protectionist trade measures. Evraz, the Russian steel and iron ore manufacturing and mining company also benefited from rising commodity prices. The NYSE Arca Steel index rose 19% during November while iron ore futures rose 26%. Tullow Oil, the oil and gas explorer and producer, rallied 12% by the month end as the shares reacted positively to the OPEC production cut announcement.<br />
        <br />
        The Swedish beauty product retailer, Oriflame, detracted from long book performance. The company reported strong Q3 earnings results but management commented that it had seen more volatility in trading so far in Q4. Following the shares&rsquo; substantial rally this year, these comments prompted some significant profit taking in the stock. Vestas Wind Systems &ndash; again one of the strongest performers in the Fund since purchase in May this year &ndash; also detracted from performance. The stock suffered following comments by Trump in his election campaign that he would not support renewable energy (and therefore possibly remove production tax credits post 2020). The shares recouped some losses in the latter stages of the month as investors took some reassurance from the high proportion &ndash; c.70% &ndash; of revenues which the company generates outside of the USA, and the increasing (recurring) revenue stream from maintenance contracts, following strong order intake in recent years.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        In the short book, one of the more significant positive contributions came from a UK-based collagen products producer for the food industry. A trading update commented that reductions in Latin America continued to have an adverse effect on margins. The company further noted that, as a result of current trading trends, sales volumes in 2017 were now expected to be 10% lower than previously anticipated. This would result in under-utilisation of manufacturing capacity which in turn would have a further adverse impact on margins. The shares fell 29% in November. The short book also benefitted from a profit warning from a UK based supplier of specialty plastic and fiber products. The shares fell 22% during the month as the company published a trading update that included lower guidance for full year operating profits. This reflected a delay in the transfer of a contract, weakness in Chinese demand in the Filtration Products division, and a weaker than expected uplift in revenue and profits in the Health &amp; Personal Care Packaging division following the completion of some site consolidation.<br />
        <br />
        A notable detractor from performance in the short book was a US-listed company that provides video marketing services. The shares rallied strongly on news that a takeover agreement had been reached at a significant premium to the shares&rsquo; previous close.

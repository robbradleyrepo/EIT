        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned 1.8%* in March. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index returned 3.6%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned 2.6% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was 1.8%.</strong></p>
        <p>With investors once again distracted by key central bank decisions as well as global political developments &ndash; with the UK&rsquo;s triggering of Article 50 and Dutch elections joining the Trump presidency at the forefront of thoughts &ndash; the small cap end of the market once again displayed evidence of its insulation from such macro considerations. While the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 posted 1.1 % and 1.4% total returns respectively in March, the FTSE Small-Cap ex-IT Index registered a 3.6% gain and the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned 2.6%.</p>
        <p>The Fund&rsquo;s largest riser was <strong>1Spatial </strong>(+123%), the embattled provider of geospatial data software &amp; services. It provided an update on the strategic review and restructuring being conducted under its new Chairman, giving some clarity to the market. Perhaps a stronger driver of the share price move, however, was a spate of director share purchases on behalf of the Chairman and the interim CEO, which served to reassure investors with regard to the strength of the group&rsquo;s current balance sheet, as well as the future potential to exploit its intellectual property to commercial advantage.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, a number of stock performance contributions were driven by the release of financial results. <strong>Croma Security Solutions</strong> (+50.4%) rose sharply after announcing interim results at the beginning of March, showing revenue up almost 30%, EBITDA growth of 63% and a 25% hike in the interim dividend. Coming on the back of several contract wins announced in late 2016 and early 2017, as well as some director share purchases in January, momentum looks to be with the company at present. Having seen its share price drop dramatically last month following an interim trading update in which it indicated that trading results for the year would be significantly second-half skewed, <strong>Tracsis&rsquo;</strong> (+15.5%) share price rebounded in March following publication of interim results. Somewhat counterintuitively, the shares had fallen at the time of the trading update despite the house analyst holding full year numbers steady, only to recover in March even as the same analyst responded to interim results by cutting full year results estimates by around 8%</p>
        <p>Shares in illustrated book publisher <strong>Quarto Group</strong> (-14.6%) were weak in the run up to final results, which were released on the last day of the month alongside news of the resignation of the CFO. Although the core publishing businesses performed well over the past year, posting 6% growth in revenue and a 17% rise in adjusted operating profit, group results were dragged down by increased losses at Books &amp; Gifts Direct (BGD), a direct sales business operating in Australia and New Zealand. The numbers validated the group&rsquo;s decision to dispose of BGD, selling the Australian portion of the business in a deal which was announced four days earlier and resulted in a further $14.2m impairment charge against profits.</p>
        <p>As flagged in its January trading update, <strong>Instem</strong> (-13.1%) has experienced a slowdown in its early-phase clinical market, offset to a degree by momentum around its technology and outsourced services offerings related to the US regulator&rsquo;s new Standard for Exchange of Non-clinical Data (SEND). Full year results released in March led to analyst revenue forecasts being held steady for FY2017 and even upped a little for FY2018, but news of additional investment in the business caused a sharp cut to forecast profitability, and sent the shares lower.</p>
        <p>Shares in <strong>Sprue Aegis</strong> (-8.5%), the manufacturer and developer of smoke and carbon monoxide alarms, temporarily dipped at the end of March on news that consumer goods giant Newell Brands had terminated its distribution and manufacturing agreements with the group. However, reaction to the news was mitigated by Sprue Aegis further announcing two replacement agreements &ndash; a manufacturing deal with multi-billion dollar contract manufacturer Flex, to produce Sprue&rsquo;s own-branded alarms at its Polish facility, as well as a supply agreement with an unnamed Far Eastern manufacturer for lower-end alarms aimed at the retail market. </p>
        <p>Among other portfolio movers, shares in the veterinary medicine supplier <strong>Animalcare</strong> (+15.0%) continued to bounce following last month&rsquo;s better-than-expected interim results while <strong>Solid State</strong> (-13.9%) lost ground after issuing a trading update in respect of the year to March. The update flagged that fourth quarter profitability was slightly less than expected due to some project delays in its high-margin antenna business. The company, which supplies ruggedised hardware expects revenue of over &pound;39m in the year to 31 March 2017, with underlying profit before tax of over &pound;3.1m. </p>
        <p>The Fund added four new positions in March: Attraqt, Bioquell, James Cropper and Medica Group.</p>
        <p><strong>Attraqt </strong>sells its site search, visual merchandising and personalised product recommendation software to online retailers such as Boohoo, Superdry and TK Maxx. The Fund invested in the stock as part of an equity placing to raise &pound;27.5m (twice the company&rsquo;s market cap prior to the deal), the proceeds of which were used to fund the reverse acquisition of competitor Fredhopper. The acquisition should be transformative to Attraqt in terms of scale, while it also brings complementary technology, clients and geographic footprint. The company fits the bill on all three of the primary intangible strengths the Economic Advantage process looks for. It has intellectual property in the software code, enjoys an embedded distribution network strength as customers come to rely increasingly on the product to drive improved conversion of &lsquo;clicks&rsquo; to sales, and also sells its products on a monthly recurring SaaS subscription basis, meaning around 90% of revenues are recurring. </p>
        <p><strong>Bioquell</strong> has been undergoing a refocusing since last summer under the stewardship of a new executive chairman, concentrating sales efforts on its core bio-decontamination intellectual property. Having followed the process closely over the past nine months, the Fund took the opportunity to initiate a position in March. The decision was taken after a set of preliminary results in which profitability beat market expectations by 15% and cash generation was robust, providing reassurance that the operational improvements put in place by new management are bearing fruit. </p>
        <p><strong>James Cropper </strong>was established in 1845 and is currently stewarded by a member of the sixth generation of the Cropper family (as Chairman). It is a manufacturer of paper and technical fibre products. The paper division focuses on high-quality, coloured paper for niche end markets such as luxury packaging, which protects the company from commoditisation. However, a much larger contributor to the business&rsquo; margins is the technical fibre division, which makes bespoke, high-performance, non-woven materials, tailored to meet the specific and demanding performance requirements of end customers in the aerospace, industrials and automotive sectors. The group holds various patents in the application of these technical fibre products, as well as having plenty of technical know-how and trade secrets in their manufacturing processes. </p>
        <p>The Fund participated in the IPO of &ldquo;tele-radiology&rdquo; specialist <strong>Medica Group</strong>. The company is a provider of outsourced radiology reporting services to UK hospitals, both helping to alleviate pressure on hospital resources during routine hours and also dramatically improving efficiency during out-of-hours periods. Medica is already a scale player in the tele-radiology market, with an estimated 60% UK market share. However, the very low penetration of outsourced radiology work (currently only around 5%) offers plenty of scope for further rapid growth. The company enjoys its Economic Advantage via all three of the investment process&rsquo; key intangible assets. Its intellectual property advantage is found in a technology platform which has benefited from heavy investment over recent years. It has both a physical distribution network advantage in the form of scale, and also becomes significantly embedded within hospital workflows once the decision is taken to outsource. The majority of its contracts are also long term (the average length being 2-3 years), providing it with an attractive recurring income profile. The IPO was heavily oversubscribed and the shares performed very well on their 21 March debut, rising 37% by the end of the month.</p>

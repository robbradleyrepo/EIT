        <ul>
            <li>We reduced Chinese exposure from a peak of 45% to slightly over 40% at the year-end (Hong Kong and China companies combined). This provided the biggest contributors to quarterly Fund performance. Overcapacity reductions and the related inflationary trends are providing short-term momentum for Chinese equities, but there have been some marginal increases in longer-term risks to growth (including forex reserve outflows and overaggressive lending).</li>
            <li>Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, there is little clarity as to how aggressive his international policy will be. While not significantly exposed to obvious areas of conflict we will have to see how policy develops over the coming year.</li>
            <li>Our base case for Asia is a further, desirable, economic slowdown. This should allow Asia Pacific shares to remain at their current fair valuations, giving the potential for c.10% expected earnings growth to be passed through in the form of share price appreciation.</li>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Asian equities fell by 1.1% in December in US$ terms, although in sterling terms the fall was offset by weakness in the pound. Things were slightly worse if Australia and New Zealand were excluded, falling 1.0% in sterling. The Liontrust Asia Income Fund rose by 0.7% over the month, taking its quarterly return to 1.5% and ending a good year in which it returned 33.3%.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The world’s understandable fixation with Trump’s march to the White House occupied financial commentators. In general terms we veer little from consensus, in that his proposed policies appear to be inflationary in the shorter term, with a significant debt burden being taken on in the longer term. This is likely to be immediately positive for equities, as markets have reflected. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">More Asia specific rhetoric is targeting China in three key areas: China manipulating its currency to gain an unfair export advantage; China’s trade advantage being tackled by tariffs; and a change in the US’s regional military stance. Little detail (or consistency) is available prior to Trump taking power, but it is possible to explain the current positioning of the portfolio in this context, taking the three in order.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, we think it relatively likely that Trump will name China as a currency manipulator. We believe this to be a false assertion, as the currency is most likely fair value (or indeed overvalued) and the Chinese government is actively intervening to strengthen it against the US dollar. It would send an easy political message home to Trump’s voters, though, while having little economic impact on China, which is what potentially makes it a tempting policy.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Trade tariffs would be a far more serious event, as the United States remains China’s largest export destination. We see these as less likely, for significant tariffs would probably lead to retaliation by the Chinese, as they have already promised. While hurting US companies (Boeing being the largest US exporter to China) there would also be an unpleasant inflationary impact for American consumers, with few jobs returning to America, instead shifting to lower-cost manufacturers in other countries. We hold two direct Chinese exporters, which could be hurt if by sentiment alone if rhetoric escalates, which may happen. The more vulnerable part of our portfolio in the event of an all-out trade war is the Taiwanese exporters – 12% of the portfolio – where we think tariffs are unlikely as technology forms such an integral and irreplaceable part of the United States economy. Some credibility to this view was given in comments from Wilbur Ross, the United States Secretary for Commerce for the incoming Trump Administration, stated on CNBC at the end of November: ‘everybody talks about tariffs as the first thing. Tariffs are the last thing. Tariffs are part of the negotiation.’ We hope this view prevails.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Most important longer-term would be a change in military positioning for the US in Asia. While recent comments increase expectations of greater US naval presence in the region, this would seem to be more a reassertion of America after a few years’ diminished involvement. Previous Trump statements would imply a lesser presence, leading to an arms race and nuclear proliferation. While neither of these is good, the lack of clarity, the inconsistency and long-term impact make it impossible for us to position the portfolio any differently with this in mind. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Trump may have stolen the limelight, but this seems rather unfair when looking at what Modi got up to in India. With no warning he announced that all INR 500 and INR 1,000 notes (effectively any bills worth more than £6) were to be retired, and could only be exchanged until December 2016. This accounts for 26% of the quantity and 88% of the value of all Indian currency in circulation. To its credit, the scheme shows quite how bold Modi is willing to be, and quite how great a grip he has, as for many the biggest surprise was that such a big project could have gone so far without having already been leaked. The negative, however, is that it is going to have a real and significant impact on the economy as a whole. We continue to have low exposure to the Indian market (which fell 5% over the last quarter of 2016 in local currency or 6.7% in US$ terms and remains the region’s weakest performer). Even with the setback, at more than 16x forward earnings we still struggle to find attractive opportunities in the country’s equity market. Our underweight in India was one of the biggest positives to performance over the quarter, assisted by strong performance from our solitary holding there, HCL Tech.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Such external events moved much of the focus away from China, which remains more than 40% of our portfolio. Despite overall market returns being negative, in the Liontrust Asia Income Fund Hong Kong and China were the biggest contributors to performance with stock specific impact from China Machinery Engineering, Anta Sports and Kingboard Laminates. While little seems to have changed there were a number of significant events that are worth mentioning. The first is that lending in China, with new loans growing 13% in 2016, the equivalent of creating a new economy the size of Italy, continues to be above sustainable levels. At some point it will have to slow, for China needs to remove its reliance on inefficient, debt-driven investment. This does not give immediate cause for alarm, and currently is likely to buoy economic growth, but it does increase the long-term chances of slow, Japanese-style failure.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Connected to this is the resurgence of foreign exchange reserves leaving the country. In October reserves fell US$46bn, in November US$69bn, and a further US$41bn in December, taking the current level to just over US$3tn from US$3.3trn at the start of 2016. While there is no imminent likelihood of a forced devaluation, we need to see lower monthly reductions in reserves. We have mentioned this many times and continue to monitor the situation very closely. China is definitely taking steps to toughen restrictions on capital flight, reducing amounts that will trigger analysis of flows and heightening the administrative burdens. As to whether they will be sufficient remains difficult to predict rather than observe. The immediate impact is that the currency is in a weak but widening exchange band, and is unlikely to change.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The final change in China is that it has seen an inflationary rebound. PPI remains positive and CPI seems to be catching up, which will give a boost to corporate earnings going forward. In part this is due to a positive attack on overcapacity. China had met 80% of capacity cut targets for coal and steel by September. Cuts have significantly accelerated since the second half of last year, and we expect the government to achieve its full year target for steel. An element of the bounce is also a result of monetary and fiscal policies. Interest rates have remained low, fiscal spending has increased and this has fed through into the general economy, particularly the housing market. The overall economic recovery globally has further reinvigorated commodity prices. While we think that some of the Trump-related rhetoric will not lead to an immediate increase in demand, the boom has already led to an increase in investment that we were not expecting. The short-term impact of this will likely be ongoing strong performance for equities, but we would question the longevity of all aspects of the recovery. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Outside China, the best performing individual stocks came from Australia – where shares in G8 and Duet rallied – a Singapore listed Indian healthcare company, RHT, and a Taiwanese technology company, Lite-On IT. The breadth of strong performance across the region shows the diversity of opportunities we are finding in the Asia Pacific region. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Overall this leaves us in a relatively benign frame of mind for 2017. There are numerous risks, admittedly, but most seem to have little direct negative impact on Asia Pacific equities. Given how unpredictable many of them are we are maintaining our positions in companies that we believe in, with solid dividends, earnings growth and cheap valuations, rather than trying to second-guess the next few moves of Donald Trump, the European electorate or Kim Jong-un. This leads us to hope for continued slowdown in Asian economies but no disaster. Regional earnings growth expectations for next year are about 10%, and we feel that current share valuations are fair and can be maintained.</p>

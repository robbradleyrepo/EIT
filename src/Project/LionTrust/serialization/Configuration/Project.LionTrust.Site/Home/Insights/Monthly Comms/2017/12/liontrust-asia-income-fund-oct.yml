            <li><strong>Sold</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Alliance Global. </strong>We exited the position in the Phillippines-based conglomerate.&nbsp; The company unexpectedly decided against paying a dividend for FY17 and instead opted for a share buyback programme.&nbsp; During the AGM, the company&rsquo;s management said it remains undecided about whether it would reinstate its annual dividend payment in FY18. Given the stock&rsquo;s strong return year-to-date, we decided to sell out of the position and switch into other alternatives offering a combination of growth and yield.</li>
            <li><strong>Bought </strong>&ndash; <strong>JNBY.</strong> A market leader in China&rsquo;s fast growing &ldquo;designer brand&rdquo; apparel market, JNBY has a market share of around 10%.&nbsp; The company is engaged in design and distribution and actively uses the WeChat&rsquo;s social media platform to promote brand awareness and customer loyalty. JNBY has 1.5m online members, with &ldquo;active members&rdquo; numbering 260,000 as of June 2017, up 36% year-on-year. It has a multi-brand portfolio, currently comprising five fashion brands targeting middle-upper income levels and different customer segmentation (children &amp; teenagers, men, women) as well as the recently launched JNBY HOME brand which is better suited to the online market given the lower requirement for product differentiation.&nbsp; Management aims to deliver 18% top-line growth, 20% profit growth, and a 75% dividend payout ratio.&nbsp; We believe its share price valuation is attractive on a PE of 11.6x next year&rsquo;s earnings estimate (assuming 20% growth) a dividend yield of 5.4% and net cash on its balance sheet.</li>

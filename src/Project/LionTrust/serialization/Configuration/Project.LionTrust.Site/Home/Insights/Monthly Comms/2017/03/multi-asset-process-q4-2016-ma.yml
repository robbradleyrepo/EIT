        <div><span style="font-size: 18px;">Q4 2016 market review: digesting a Trump victory and all-time market highs</span><br>
        </div>
        <p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        Developments in the US dominated the fourth quarter, with only the second rate rise from the Federal Reserve in a decade and the world continuing to digest the ramifications of a Trump presidency.<br><br>
        This latest hike – another 0.25% rise in the key rate to 0.5% to 0.75% – was widely anticipated and priced into markets but the move did cause the dollar to rally to a 14-year high, with Fed chair Janet Yellen’s comments seen as potentially signalling a further three rises in 2017.<br><br>
        Guessing where the President Elect will focus policy is no easy task as his campaigning included more pledges than could be implemented during a term in the White House. That said, dominant themes seem to be trade, immigration and infrastructure spend within an overall reflationary policy of investment and cutting taxes.<br><br>
        While the result came as a shock, investors came to expect the unexpected in 2016. Markets are still working out the implications of Brexit and early in December, Italy decided to reject Prime Minister Renzi’s plans for constitutional reform. Fears over what potential problems in Italy might mean had already caused tremors and with Renzi resigning after his defeat, markets have another bout of uncertainty to digest.<br><br>
        Despite all these shocks however – and UK inflation hitting a two-year high in November – the FTSE 100 actually ended 2016 at an all-time peak, boosted by miners and dollar earners in December. The market closed out the month above the 7100 level and posted a 14.4% gain over the year, the best annual performance since 2013. This should also be seen in the context of a serious slump early in the year, where the FTSE 100 dropped just below 5500 in February on the back on global growth fears, with the index up 30% over the rest of the year despite Brexit, Trump and a range of other concerns.<br><br>
        As stated, miners have been a key factor in this performance, with recovery in China and the prospect of infrastructure spending by Trump administration driving many of these companies to strong returns. A heavy slump in sterling since the Brexit vote – falling 16.5% over 2016 - has also been beneficial for companies that earn their money overseas and there is a clear split in the market along these lines. In dollar terms, the FTSE 100 was actually down 5% over the year because of the decline in the pound and analysts at KPMG have calculated that while companies with more than 70% of their market outside the UK were up around 20% over the year, those with 70% of their business in the UK were down 6%.<br><br>
        Elsewhere around the world, the US also enjoyed a strong end to the year, with the Dow Jones getting close to breaching the 20,000 level for the first time in the final days of 2016.<br><br>Looking into 2017 – although if this year has shown us anything, it is that making predictions is a fool’s errand – consensus is suggesting we could face a more volatile year with European elections, the triggering of Brexit discussions and the reality of Trump in the White House. Many also expect a delayed impact on the UK economy from sterling’s weakness and it will be important to keep an eye on consumer spending as inflation starts to bite.<br><br>
        As ever, we continue to reiterate our long-term philosophy and approach: we run target risk portfolios and focus on the long term, with fundamental valuation driving our tactical asset allocation. We have had cash in the portfolios for a while and will look for any bargains as the dust settles.<br><br>
        For those concerned about Trump, multi-decade returns have shown that, whichever political party is ultimately in power in the US, the economy and stock market tend to carry on regardless. Certain sectors will tend to benefit more than others depending on the backdrop however, which – over the long term – strengthens the case for active managers.
        <br><br><p>In terms of our portfolios, we did not feel it necessary to move aggressively ahead of the US election as we already see US equities as expensive. The early reaction was reminiscent of what happened post-Brexit but the lesson we took from that was not to read too much into the short-term response to political events. Brexit panic represented an opportunity for bargain-hunting active managers and I suspect this may happen again.</p><p><br>
        Meanwhile, we are continuing to focus on a key shift in the bond market, with rising yields suggesting the bubble may have finally burst. We have seen yields back up before only to resume their multi-year bull trend but the asset class now looks one of the most expensive ever and it seems likely we have reached an inflexion point.</p><p><br>
        We maintain our longstanding underweight but the diversification benefits continue to justify an allocation in a balanced portfolio. Investors now have to look to other means of generating income and low-volatility returns, with the options including real estate, long/short equity strategies and strategic bond funds.</p><p><br>
        We remain patient in terms of putting money back into markets – having trimmed back exposure pre-Brexit – although there are obvious expensive (US) and cheaper (Europe, Japan) areas at present. Emerging markets/Asia have also been somewhat left behind in the post-Trump rally on concerns about protectionism and a stronger dollar, creating an opportunity to top up positions.</p>

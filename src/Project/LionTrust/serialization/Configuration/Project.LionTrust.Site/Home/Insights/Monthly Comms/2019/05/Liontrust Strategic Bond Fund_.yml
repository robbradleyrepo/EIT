        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>In the March commentary, we reiterated how expensive sovereign debt was, even by excessive recent standards. Since then we have seen a small market retracement. UK Gilts posted a negative return on the month, Bunds were flat and US Treasuries just about made people money. That absolute and relative performance suited fund positioning. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Economic data continued to accelerate and drive a wedge between macro numbers and market expectations for central bank action. A growing source of concern for the bears is that risk asset levels are at least in part predicated on even easier monetary policy. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Two statistics at this point:</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-left: 40px;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>US GDP: Q1 2019, expected 2.3%, actual 3.2%. That’s a nominal rate of growth of over 5%.</span></li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>German CPI: April 2019, expected 1.7%, actual 2.1%. That’s above the European Central Bank’s target level.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Equity and credit markets have of course powered ahead. Cash and short bonds offer increasingly negative real yields, forcing folk to chase risk to earn some income. As long as we convince ourselves the Fed and ECB are there for the market, </span><em style="font-size: 1.5rem;">not</em><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> the economy, we can believe in goldilocks and happy endings.</span><br></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>President Trump certainly is encouraging even more risk taking, pressuring the Fed to cut. Someone really has to tell him you shouldn’t run an economy as you run a real estate empire. Setting up holding companies, borrowing in their name, dividend stripping and subsequently overleveraging and defaulting is much more difficult to achieve repeatedly at sovereign level – ask Greece, or Venezuela. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Rates</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br>I have to say that rates markets held up much better in April than expected (again!). The combination of decent data and horrible values could have led to material losses for investors. Mid-month, core government markets had fallen by 1%-2%, but recovered as the weight of money chasing yields started to flow back in. That has been the case for a decade now, that technical, QE-led support has prevented yields rising to fair values. Sovereign investors haven’t made much money in nominal terms for nearly four years now and have lost a lot in real terms, but the rise of index trackers, passive funds and asset liability matchers means there is a steady demand for bonds, in addition to that directly controlled and manipulated by central banks. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>So what worked for us in rates markets? We remained “beta light”. We played a bit with duration† moving up from 2 to 3 years as rates markets sold off – as a reminder German bonds were paying -10 basis points at one stage before moving back closer to +10bp, which represents a move of nearly 2% in price. So, the lack of beta helped and our normal alpha plays also added a little value. We want to remain low beta though and have been careful not to allow any short-term changes to the portfolio offset that long-term view. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>US Bonds remained our winners of the sovereign debt “least ugly” contest. Among the G10 they are about the only ones where income offsets inflation. Almost all our sovereign debt exposure was in the US and this worked well. </span></p>
        <span><br clear="all">
        </span>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Allocation</strong><br></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We retained our underweight position in most parts of the market. We continued to substitute higher beta for lower beta, so the raw weightings at fund level appeared little changed.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>About 40% of the Fund was invested in sovereign debt, offset by nearly 20% short using bond futures. This created cross market and curve opportunities, most of which worked at the margin. The net duration position from sovereign bonds once futures were deducted was close to zero.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The historic modest correlation between investment grade debt and large cap equities continued. With the S&amp;P 500 hitting a record high during the month, it was no surprise investment grade spreads did okay. Despite prices looking a little stretched, we added a little to the raw weight, moving to around 40% net of derivatives. This is a little lower than our median of 50%, reflecting how expensive the market is. In the medium term we are modestly positive on investment grade credit – the majority of excess returns have been made for the year, but downside risk is limited as global growth continues around trend. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Currently we are down around 12% in high yield against a neutral weight of 20%. Add in the 40% investment grade though and we still have half our portfolio in risk assets, albeit increasingly defensive ones. High yield in particular has had a phenomenal start to the year. Given the nature of this Fund’s strategy, we can afford to reduce the weighting simply because the market looks overbought in the short term. However, we doubt we will go much below 10% unless our macroeconomic view changes – for now we still expect trend growth and inflation for 2019 despite all the central bank doom mongering. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Our preferred emerging market basket (US CDX EM) is close to a three-month low. Most other markets, investment grade, equity and high yield are near their all-time highs. Emerging market fundamentals have deteriorated a bit, which makes me cautious about adding. We may put a small position into the Fund, which currently has a zero weighting. Just don’t expect it in the next few weeks. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br>Positive selection was the major reason why the Fund added value in a tricky period whilst maintaining a low risk profile:</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>US rates markets did much better than Asian (ex-Antipodean) or European ones and we had most of our risk in the US. Canada initially outperformed, allowing us to add to our short and then started to slide as data proved too hot for trend investors to handle. Curve trades in US and German markets made us a few pennies, the former modestly steepening, the latter flattening and then steepening, allowing us to make money and rotate. We had added to our inflation protected US bonds and these did very nicely. Last, we made a bit of money moving out of and then back into the UK. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Cash flow in the Fund remained strong but we didn’t add many new names or chase the primary market, we were conscientious in topping up our existing holdings. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Our existing investment grade and high yield bonds generally performed well, in some cases exceeding our price targets and leading to sales or reductions. We continue to work down the subordinated debt we added in December during that long forgotten market panic. Many of those bonds have returned 10% or more in four months. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The strongest April performers in credit in the Fund all added a few basis points. The most apt description of alpha was of shallow and broad rather than narrow and deep contribution.&nbsp; Subordinated bonds in AIG and EDF continued to rally, and as mentioned above we have been reducing exposure to this higher beta part of the credit market.&nbsp; Other notable contributors were Vodafone and Dell.&nbsp; A new position was established in Andarko as we expect spreads to converge toward those of its new owner, whether that ends up being Occidental or Chevron affects the size of the upside but not the direction. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Offsetting this slightly was a negative contribution from Norwegian Government bonds, which continue to be unloved as the economy performed very nicely. I was too soon to buy these bonds, which are around four years to maturity, but it is just nice to have part of the portfolio generating decent income.</span></p>

        <p><strong><span>Key Risks </span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The majority of the Liontrust Sustainable Future Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Some of these funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and has a concentrated portfolio of securities, there is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund’s share price. Liontrust SF Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Corporate Bond Fund, Liontrust SF Cautious Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Defensive Managed Fund and Liontrust Monthly Income Bond Fund invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions, it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the bonds held by these funds. Mentioned above five funds can also invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interests rates move or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions.</span></p>

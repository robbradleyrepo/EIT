        <p><strong>The Fund’s A5 share class returned -2.3%* in euro terms in November (A4 share class -2.3%). This compares with the -1.9% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index.</strong></p>
        <p>The month started off with a flurry of central bank news, with the Bank of England raising rates for the first time in over a decade to 0.5%, while US President Donald Trump announced that Jerome Powell will be the next Federal Reserve chair. There were also some complications with Germany’s leadership as coalition talks between Angela Merkel’s CDU party and the Free Democrats broke down, keeping investors on their toes.</p>
        <p>However for most of the month, the focus was very much on corporate earnings. The MSCI Europe Small Cap and MSCI Europe indices both experienced their second biggest monthly fall of the year so far. Weakness in European equities was largely broad based, though cyclical areas appeared to underperform the most, with consumer discretionary (-3.5%), industrials (-3.3%) and IT (-2.7%) sectors the biggest fallers in the MSCI Europe in euro terms. The sole sector to gain this month was real estate (+1.3%).</p>
        <p>The Fund’s largest underperformer was <strong>Shouw &amp; Co </strong>(-12.9%) after issuing third quarter results which were below market expectations at the revenue and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) level. Management also cautioned that “there are indications of excess capacity occurring in the near future, which would make markets even more competitive and put prices, terms and conditions under pressure”.</p>
        <p><strong>Lenzing </strong>(-12.2%) was also a notable detractor. The Austrian textile company reported a 9.4% annual rise in the first nine months of the year to €1.73bn while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 23.9% to €397m. However, Chief Executive Stefan Doboczky stated while operating results in 2017 are set to be an improvement from 2016, there will be more headwinds in 2018. The stock was sold from the portfolio later in the month following a deterioration in some of our investment process screen scores. Construction and manufacturing company Bergman &amp; Beving was sold for the same reason. </p>
        <p>Nordic construction and engineering group <strong>Peab </strong>(-9.3%) was another faller after reporting net sales of SEK11.6bn, which was just short of the consensus estimate of SEK11.7bn, though profit before tax came in slightly ahead. Management maintained a positive outlook, referencing a solid order backlog and a good project mix. However, they warned of challenges including capacity limitations, increases in subcontractor costs and rising land prices.</p>
        <p>Despite a tough market backdrop, there were a number of holdings which ended the month higher. Cosmetics company <strong>Oriflame Holding</strong> (+7.5%) was one of the gainers after it reported upbeat results for the third quarter of 2017. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 30% year-on-year to €40m, beating analyst expectations of €35.5m. Sales of €295m in the third quarter also came in ahead of the market’s forecast of €294m, representing a 6% improvement from the previous year.</p>
        <p>London-listed seals, filters and cylinders supplier <strong>Diploma </strong>(+7.1%) reached a record high share price after proposing a 15% increase in its total dividend for the year to end September 2017. The company stated this is reflective of a strong financial position and confidence in its prospects. Other fundamentals over the year reflected this strength, with pre-tax profit up 24% and adjusted earnings per share up 19%.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Liberbank (+15.9%), APG SGA (+9.4%) and Oriflame Holding (+7.5%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Schouw &amp; Co (-12.9%), Lenzing (-12.2%) and Eurocell (-11.9%).</p>

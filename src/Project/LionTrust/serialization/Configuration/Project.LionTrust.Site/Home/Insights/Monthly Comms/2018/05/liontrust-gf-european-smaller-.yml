        <strong>The Fund’s A5 share class returned 3.6%* in euro terms in April (A4 share class 3.6%). This compares with the 4.1% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index.<br>
        </strong><br>
        After a poor start to the year, European equities registered their first positive month since January. This followed seemingly encouraging developments in the trade tensions between the US and China which had plagued the market in March. While China unveiled retaliatory tariffs of up to 25% on certain US imported goods following on from Trump’s announcements of Chinese import levies in March, there was more optimism that the two nations would avoid a trade war.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Another source for the market’s gains was the rise in the oil price. North Sea benchmark Brent oil rose to US$75/barrel for the first time since late 2014 with Opec supply cuts continuing to have their intended impact of reducing global inventories and raising prices. Increasing geopolitical concerns also contributed to oil’s latest leg higher, with Trump signalling that he wants to withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal.<br>
        <br>
        The rise in oil prices was reflected in the sector breakdown in the MSCI Europe Index where energy (+12.7% in euro terms) was by far and away the largest contributor to the index’s performance. The Fund participated in the energy rally with strong returns from Hunting (+19.0%), Soco International (+13.9%) and Tethys Oil (+13.3%). Additionally, Hunting released a trading update noting that revenue in the first three months of 2018 had been similar to the previous quarter. It added that strong cash generation allowed it to maintain a net cash position of US$3.6m at quarter end despite increases in working capital outflows.<br>
        <span> </span><br>
        There were a number of first quarter results in April. French mining and metallurgical group ERAMET (+24.8%) saw revenue in the period grow 2% year-on-year helped by strong growth in the spot prices of both manganese ore and nickel, though this was dampened slightly by a decrease in the euro-dollar exchange rate. The company added that positive trends had continued into the second quarter but noted that metal prices are volatile due to escalated tensions and uncertainties in international trade relations.&nbsp;<br>
        <strong><br>
        Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarril’s</strong> (-5.2%) Q1 statement was less well received. The Spanish railway vehicle and equipment manufacturer’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of €44.4m came in short of the consensus estimate of €49.3m, though revenue of €439m was above the market forecast and was 29% higher than the same period last year.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Shares in Germany’s <strong>Software AG </strong>(-3.9%) declined after first quarter sales of €187m at constant currency fell short of the consensus estimate of €202m and represented a fall of 9.4% from the same time last year. Iron ore pellet producer<strong> Ferrexpo </strong>(-4.0%), meanwhile, reported a 1.6% year-on-year decline in pellet production for the first quarter of 2018. This was down 7.0% on a quarterly basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Away from earnings, Danish shipping and logistics group <strong>DFDS</strong> (+14.0%) was involved in significant M&amp;A activity. The company agreed to buy UN Ro-Ro Isletmeleri, Turkey’s largest operator of roll-on/roll-off freight ships, for US$1.2bn. The deal would mark DFDS’s largest ever acquisition.<br>
        <br>
        We are undertaking our annual review of companies’ reports and accounts, which dictates the major changes to the Fund’s holdings. This year’s review has so far resulted in the sales of the following: APG, Brembo, Eurocell, Grainger, Hexpol, Liberbank, Momentum Group, Schouw &amp; Co, Straumann Holding, Sydbank and Vontabel Holding.<br>

        <br>
        <strong>Positive contributors to performance included:<br>
        </strong>Hunting (+19.0%), DFDS (+14.0%) and Soco International (+13.9%).<br>
        <br>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>2017 was a busy year for IPOs (initial public offerings) on the London market – 106 of them raised £15bn in funds for the companies involved. Almost half of these (49) were via the AIM market, a 29% increase on 2016’s number of new companies.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>This year has started more slowly, but we have still seen 15 companies join London’s main market (to end April), while AIM has welcomed 12.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>On most occasions when we apply our investment process, it is to a company that is already listed on the London Stock Exchange. Here, we would be participating in the ‘secondary market’ – investors exchanging an existing stock of shares in a company. This is how we have populated the majority of our Funds – after all, there are 946 companies on the LSE’s Main Market and a further 941 on AIM to choose from. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The ‘primary market’ covers instances such as IPOs when we can invest in ‘new’ shares; this also includes placings and rights issues, where a company raises money by selling shares. While placings and rights issues raise additional funds for a company listed on a stockmarket, an IPO deals with the initial admission of a company’s shares to an exchange. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Investing in an IPO comes with its own unique set of challenges but we have found that the primary market has provided a good pipeline of potential investments for our funds, particularly at the small-cap and micro-cap end of the market. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>In principle we apply exactly </span><span>the same investment criteria to the assessment of IPOs as to equity available in the secondary market. In practicality, the typical profile of a company joining the market and the mechanics of the listing process do mean that there are some differences in the way we apply our investment framework. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>For us to invest in a business, the first stage is to confirm that it possesses ‘Economic Advantage’ in the form of at least one of the three intangible assets we seek: recurring income, intellectual property and strong distribution networks. We need to gain an in-depth understanding of a company’s business model and characteristics to make a judgement on whether it possesses these intangibles. Our ability to make this assessment is largely unaffected by whether we are dealing with an IPO or established stockmarket listing.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>It is at the second stage of our process – seeking evidence of superior financial returns – that we encounter some differences. For currently listed companies there is usually a wealth of historic financial information and reports which can be delved into. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>By contrast, a company approaching an IPO – while providing documentation including a comprehensive prospectus – will typically have less historic financial information available, especially if the business is itself </span><span>relatively young. Historic balance sheet and profit &amp; loss accounts may additionally need adjusting if the IPO proceeds will </span><span>fund changes to the business or balance sheet – by paying down a chunk of debt for instance. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Despite the uncertainties created by the absence of a ‘track record’ as a listed company, there are compelling reasons to selectively participate in IPOs. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The most obvious attraction is valuation – this is the third step in our investment process.&nbsp; All things being equal, shares in a company coming to market will be available at a discount to listed peers in order to provide compensation for the uncertainties. As the company proves itself over time, this discount would be expected to narrow. Investors willing to conduct proprietary research and meet management can therefore benefit from this risk discount narrowing – an opportunity that is not always available on the secondary market. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>As well as a risk discount, another factor often leading to attractive IPO pricing is the desire of vested interests to “get it away”. If shares in an IPO are priced too expensively then they will be under-subscribed, damaging the credibility of the broker and leading to the IPO being cancelled, or postponed and reset at a lower level. This creates a bias to price IPOs keenly in order to attract interest, create over-subscription and raise the likelihood of the share price performing well initially. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>A further appeal of IPOs is that they often enable investors to tap into new, emerging industries and ‘get in on the ground floor’. While this opens up the possibility of significant upside, it also requires a discerning eye to avoid investments with faddish or bubble characteristics which are aiming for blue sky returns but have little prospect of achieving them. Our investment process has built-in criteria which are designed to reduce the chance of exposure to these risky stocks – we only invest in profitable companies for example, and avoid those with weak balance sheets or an overaggressive approach to acquisitions. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>It is safe to assume from the above that we are very selective in judging which IPOs to participate in. We turn down far more opportunities than we invest in, as only a few will meet our investment criteria. We also take a conservative approach via our risk scoring process, making sure any higher risks are reflected in a lower portfolio holding size. Nevertheless, the ‘primary market’ of IPOs forms a key component of our prospective investment pipeline. Overall, if we see evidence of Economic Advantage which is converting to good cash flow returns, we will then look at the pricing of the IPO to see if an attractive risk/reward trade-off is available and in some cases it will be. Of the 13 stocks we have added to the Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund over the last year, four were via IPOs. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Historically, some of our funds’ most consistent performers have been sourced via IPOs. Craneware is a great example, having entered our portfolios on its stockmarket flotation in 2007. </span><span>Craneware is the largest provider of pricing and billing systems to American hospitals and is a relatively rare instance of a stock which possesses all three of the intangible assets our Economic Advantage investment process looks for. </span><span>Since then, it has been more than a “16 bagger” in investment jargon – on a total return basis, with dividends reinvested in the security, it has made investors more than 1600% over the course of a decade*. </span></p>

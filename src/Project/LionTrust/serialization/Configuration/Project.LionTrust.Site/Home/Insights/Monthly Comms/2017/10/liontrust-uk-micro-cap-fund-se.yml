        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned -0.2%* in September. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index returned 1.1%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned -0.5% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was 0.5%.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The majority of the Fund’s share price activity in September can be attributed to companies issuing newsflow covering the period to 30 June.&nbsp; This was certainly the case for the largest contributor, <strong>Bioventix</strong> (+24.7%), which issued a full year trading update stating that revenues and profits before tax are expected to be ahead of market consensus for the year to 30 June 2017, with the former amounting to slightly more than £7m.</p>
        <p><strong>K3 Capital </strong>(+16.5%) had already guided towards a strong performance in in its own trading update in June. It had conservatively suggested that revenue and normalised EBITDA would be “comfortably in line” with market expectations at the time, and full year results released in September more than delivered on this promise. Revenue grew 26% to £10.8m while normalised EBITDA rose 25% to £4.7m. The company, which completed an IPO in April, specialises in assisting in company sales and was named ‘Most active dealmaker’ in the first half of 2017 by Thomson Reuters Small Cap M&amp;A Review. The statement struck a positive tone regarding current small cap M&amp;A conditions and the outlook for the business. The M&amp;A market is described as robust, with volumes above the 10 year average as foreign bidders looking to exploit weak sterling have more than offset the impact of economic uncertainty ahead of Brexit. K3 Capital further stated that its start to the new financial year has again been “comfortably in line with management expectations”, with two significant transactions completed – each with fees in excess of £1m.</p>
        <p>In September, <strong>Avingtrans </strong>(-17.4%) released full year results, but the share price fall is more a function of recent M&amp;A activity which investors are still digesting. The company is something of a mini-conglomerate owning a number of businesses<strong> </strong>producing critical components for the energy and medical sectors. Avingtrans is building a good track record of identifying attractively valued acquisitions and is open to selling these assets on at the right price, naming its growth strategy PIE – ‘Pinpoint-Invest-Exit’. It has shown off this approach in the last year through a £19.4m tender offer to shareholders to return the proceeds from the sale of its aerospace division. It also showed its eye for undervalued assets by snapping up Hayward Tyler Group – another Fund holding – via a reverse takeover. Avingtrans’ full year results included a 7% increase in sales to £22.7m while adjusted PBT improved to £0.3m from £0.1m. It announced a final dividend of 2.2p, taking the full year total to 3.4p, up from last year’s 3.2p.</p>
        <p>Interim results from <strong>Learning Technologies</strong> (+15.2%) showed revenue growth of 68% to £21.5m. The growth was split roughly 50:50 between organic expansion and acquisitions after the company completed the purchase of NetDimensions. Learning Technologies is an e-learning specialist targeting expansion to £100m in annual revenues in the medium term, and describes NetDimensions as the “final key technical capability” that will allow it to offer corporate and public sector clients a fully comprehensive service. The company also commented that the start to the second half of 2017 had seen “trading ahead of management’s expectations and [an] order book significantly ahead of the prior year on a like for like basis”.</p>
        <p><strong>Judges Scientific</strong> (+11.5%) reported a 20% increase in interim revenues to £32.7m as three of its scientific instrumentation businesses continued to recover from the weak demand which held back growth in the first half of 2016 and resulted in two profit warnings. Organic order intake was up 28% year-on-year in the first half of 2016 with the organic order book now at 16.5 weeks. The strength of its order book underpins management’s confidence in delivering a full year performance in line with market expectations.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Having rallied substantially since May, shares in <strong>Focusrite</strong> (-12.9%) experienced some profit taking following the release of a trading update for the year to 31 August. The company expects revenue of £66m, representing 13% constant currency growth year-on-year, and it states that good gross profit trends on its music and audio products will also see year-on-year profit expansion.</p>
        <p><strong>Surgical Innovations</strong> (-10.1%) specialises in designing, developing and manufacturing devices for use in minimally invasive abdominal surgery. The company released interim results which it described as being towards the upper end of its range of expectations. Revenues grew by 14% to £3.5m and it expanded its gross margin from 33.8% to 38%. Surgical Innovations comments that current trading in the second six months of its year is satisfactory. In August, the company acquired its sole UK distributor, giving it full control of its route to market, and the integration of the business is progressing smoothly. Having appeared to get ahead of themselves in the wake of the deal, the shares eased off in September.</p>
        <p>Finally,<strong> Science Group</strong> (+9.7%) completed the acquisition of Technology Sciences Group, a scientific advisory and regulatory services provider to a variety of industries through US and European subsidiaries, for an initial consideration of US$17m. The acquired businesses had revenues and PBT of around US$20m and US$1m respectively in the most recent financial period. The deal strengthens Science Group’s presence in the US, establishes a footprint in continental Europe and complements its existing advisory and advanced product development services for science and technology initiatives.</p>

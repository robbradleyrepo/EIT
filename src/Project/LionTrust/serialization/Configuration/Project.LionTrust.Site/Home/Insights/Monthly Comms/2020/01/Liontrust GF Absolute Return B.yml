        <p class="Body" style="text-align: left;"><b>The Liontrust GF Absolute Return Bond Fund (C5 share <span style="color: windowtext;">class) returned 0.6%* in sterling terms in Q4 2019, compared with the IA Targeted Absolute Return sector average of 1.0</span>%. <span style="color: black;">The primary US dollar share class (B5) returned 1.0%.</span><span style="color: black;"> </span></b></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>As widely anticipated by economic forecasters and the bond markets, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points to a 1.50-1.75% range at the end of October. This is the third such reduction in rates, with the loosening in monetary policy referred to by the Fed as “insurance cuts”. Previous occasions where rate cuts were framed in this way occurred in the 1990s; both times also saw 75 basis points of cuts.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The quarter also experienced Mario Draghi’s reign coming to an end. He hands over a restarted QE (Quantitative Easing) programme to the new ECB President Christine Lagarde; the former French minister of the economy and finance, and more recently managing director of the IMF. Eurozone monetary policy has long since passed the “reversal rate”, the level at which further loosening becomes counterproductive. Productivity growth remains moribund as low rates distort executive incentive structures and keep zombie companies afloat. To be clear, Draghi is by no means the only culprit of this counterproductive addiction to QE, but he certainly has been one of the worst offenders.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We would be very surprised if 2020 proves to be a year where you are rewarded for blindly owning bond beta. The over-riding message from most of the developed market central banks is that they have done as much policy loosening as they intend to.&nbsp; One of the key themes for 2020 will be the increased emphasis on the fiscal side of the policy equation to do the heavy lifting at boosting growth. An increased fiscal deficit is almost inevitable in the UK, Japan and most of the eurozone; even Germany is likely to reduce its budget surplus. In the US, the fiscal loosening had already occurred with a deficit of approximately 4.5% of GDP. From that level it is difficult to envisage much more government largesse, but in an election year nothing can be ruled out entirely.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Economic data improved over the quarter with many signs that global industrial production has found a base. Furthermore, the mood music surrounding trade talks between the US and China has been soothing with a phase-one trade deal due to be signed on January 15th. Government bond yields rose, and credit spreads tightened, just as one would anticipate in such an environment.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Overall, we are pretty much in line with the market consensus in saying that world economic growth will be stronger this year and trade tensions will dissipate but not disappear. Where we differ from consensus is on the inflation front. Many labour markets are tight and the negative price impulse from the industrial production growth collapse is fading whilst services inflation remains remarkably sticky. Global inflation is likely to be above 2% in 2020, not necessarily worrisome but completely at odds with the yields on quality sovereign debt creating a recipe for further financial repression.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Carry Component</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We split the Fund into the Carry Component and three Alpha Sources for clarity in reporting, but it is worth emphasising we manage the Fund’s positioning and risk in its entirety. We have continued to run with a reasonably low duration, in the ballpark of 0.75 years for most of the quarter. This is 0.25 years higher than in the third quarter of 2019 as the short end of the US yield curve has become upward sloping again. Toward the end of December an extra 0.25 years was added but profits have since been taken on this addition on the second trading day of 2020.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br />A natural implication of an upward sloping base rate to 5 year curve in the US is that we will gradually reduce the Fund’s floating rate note (FRN) weighting; the steeper the curve the more we prefer conventional bonds.&nbsp; From an intra-month peak of approximately 40% in August, the FRN weighting is already down to 27%. The holdings in conventional bonds and FRNs have good diversity; proceeds of bond maturities enable us to reinvest in desired companies and bond tenors reasonably rapidly with low transaction costs. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The Carry Component represented three quarters of the Fund’s assets at year end and continues to generate a steady yield backbone of the portfolio.&nbsp; The duration contribution of the euro denominated carry is hedged out using 5-year German BOBL futures.&nbsp; Our preference for taking US duration exposure within the Carry Component over European was beneficial during the quarter and full year.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Alpha Sources</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>(i) Rates</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We successfully closed out a pair trade for the Fund, owning 10-year Swiss government bonds and selling the German Bund future. Both are AAA-rated sovereigns that benefit from any flight-to-quality flows; Swiss debt had lagged, creating a spread between the two that was too narrow. We took advantage of this dislocation to generate a small profit for the Fund. The inflation breakeven position in Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) was closed out at a loss.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The Fund re-entered a Norwegian 5-year sovereign debt versus short German 5-year BOBL future 0.5 years’ duration position. There is small positive carry in holding this position as well as potential capital upside if the spread between Norway and Germany compresses, as it has done on previous occasions. In smaller 0.25 years’ size we’ve also entered a long New Zealand 10-year bonds versus short Australian government bond futures cross market position.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>(ii) Allocation</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>A new allocation position was implemented during the quarter. The Fund is long risk to the iTraxx Europe Credit Default Swap index (this index is often referred to as “Main”) and short the same amount of the iTraxx Senior Financial Credit Default Swap index. The spread between the two indices has compressed far too far; one should expect the financials CDS index to be higher beta and more vulnerable during any period of heightened fears of systemic risk. By the end of 2019 the position was a couple of basis points onside and simple mean reversion suggests that the position could do the same again this quarter.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>(iii) Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Most of the current selection positions in the Fund had a very small positive contribution during the quarter, reflective of their defensive nature. A new long-dated position was established in <strong>Eli Lilly</strong>, a high-quality pharmaceutical company with a focus on diabetes treatment and growing exposure to oncology and pain management. Its organic development pipeline looks excellent and it has only one significant patent expiry before 2025. The euro-denominated bonds trade with credit spreads significantly wider than the host US dollar market and represent fantastic absolute and relative value in our view. We purchased the 30-year tenor, which is a less-developed part of the euro credit market compared to dollars and sterling; we like the credit spread but not the interest rate risk, so we have removed the duration contribution from the bonds using German 30-year BUXL futures. </span></p>

        <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #222222;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

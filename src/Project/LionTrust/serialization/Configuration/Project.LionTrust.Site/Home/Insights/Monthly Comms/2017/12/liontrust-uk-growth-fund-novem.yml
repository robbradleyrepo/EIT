        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><strong>The Liontrust UK Growth Fund returned -1.3%* in November, compared with the -1.7% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">The focus early in the month was on the Bank of England’s historic rate rise, its first for over a decade. The move was well flagged, but the market reaction after the decision suggested that investors do not expect any further tightening in policy in the near future. Sterling slipped following the announcement but during the rest of the month it more than regained the lost value. </p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">General UK equity weakness this month was largely derived from underwhelming earnings reports, with large-cap stocks underperforming (FTSE 100 returning -1.8% compared to the FTSE 250’s -1.2% and the FTSE Small Cap’s -0.8%).</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">Within the Fund, the biggest large cap detractor was <strong>Compass Group </strong>(-9.3%) which fell despite releasing strong full-year numbers. The catering company reported a 15% increase in headline revenue and an 18% improvement in operating profits. Both revenue and profit were boosted by an 11% translational benefit from weaker sterling. Management provided another positive outlook, citing an encouraging pipeline of new contracts and expected progress on efficiencies. However, growth is expected to be second half weighted which slightly disappointed the market.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><strong>Ultra Electronics </strong>(-29.9%) experienced a difficult month. The company issued a profit warning highlighting funding issues to UK defence programmes which resulted in the UK Ministry of Defence pausing, cancelling or delaying numerous programmes. Ultra Electronics now expects full year revenue to be around £770m and organic revenue to show a decline of around 4.0%. Underlying operating profit is guided to be c.£120m compared to &nbsp;£131m last year. Additionally, the company announced that Chief Executive Rakesh Sharma had stepped down following “a period of reflection” by the Non-Executive Directors on future leadership. The negative read-across on defence spending weighed on the share price of aerospace and defence engineer <strong>BAE Systems </strong>(-7.0%). </p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">There were, however, some bright spots this month. Health and environmental technology group <strong>Halma </strong>(+8.3%) was among them after reporting upbeat interim results. For the six months to end of September 2017, its revenue rose 15% year-on-year with growth across all of the company’s geographic exposures while pre-tax profit was up 12%. Management hiked the interim dividend payment by 7% and added that order intake following the end of the review period has been ahead of revenue and order intake last year. <strong>Spirax-Sarco Engineering </strong>(+2.0%) noted sales in the four months to October increased modestly from the first half of the year and operating profit for the first ten months of 2017 is comfortably ahead of the same period last year. </p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">Financial intermediary companies <strong>TP ICAP </strong>(-7.1%) and <strong>NEX Group </strong>(-6.5%) were both among the weakest performers following updates. TP ICAP noted a 3% year-on-year increase in pro forma revenue in the third quarter of 2017 despite mixed market conditions. However, the group stated that the outlook for the fourth quarter remains challenging and that its chief financial officer was stepping down. NEX Group released interim results for the six months to end September. The company reported a fall in pre-tax profit to £48m from £66m last year, impacted by an £11m hit from one-off items and increases in underlying effective tax rate. The company also rebased its dividend payment to 3.5p from 11.5p.</p>

        <span>• Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</span></div>

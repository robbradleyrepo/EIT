        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund returned 1.2%* in sterling terms in January compared with the 0.7% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p>The MSCI World rose 0.6% in January. Strength in US equities was offset by the dollar retracing some of its gains after hitting a fresh multi-year high early in the month; the Dollar Index showed the currency down 2.6% in trade-weighted terms.</p>
        <p>The price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average went above the symbolic 20,000 points level for the first time while the S&amp;P 500 Index hit a new high of 2,298 before later in the month it suffered its worst one day decline since the Presidential election. Donald Trump was inaugurated during the month and uncertainty over his policies continued to influence asset prices. Attempts to enforce a travel ban led to a resurgence of worries over the extent of his protectionism (having already withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his first day in office), while comments on tougher government bargaining put pressure on the pharmaceuticals sector. </p>
        <p>The Fund continues to have a low proportion of direct investments in the US, owing to the market&rsquo;s largely prohibitive valuations. Fund returns from stock selection in January were good, while the low US dollar exposure (relative to the Index and sector) was beneficial this month.</p>
        <p>Seagate Technology (+16.1%) reported a robust set of results for the second quarter of its fiscal year and struck an upbeat tone in its outlook comments. The company generated US$2.9bn in revenue and achieved a gross margin of 31%, boosting net income to US$297m &ndash; a level which was ahead of consensus expectations and resulted in upgrades to full year forecasts. Management stated it is confident in the long-term opportunity to benefit from the shift in business and consumer storage to cloud and mobile applications. </p>
        <p>Shares in Ashmore Group (+9.7%) slid in Q4 2016 as US interest rate expectations rose and the dollar firmed, clouding the investment outlook for emerging market asset classes. With a lot of these negatives having been priced in, it rallied in January on the release of a trading statement which quantified the scale of negative investment returns and fund outflows. The company&rsquo;s assets under management declined only 4%, or US$2.4bn in the three months to 31 December 2016 as investment losses knocked off US$1.7bn and a further US$0.7bn left in outflows.</p>
        <p>Fred Olsen&rsquo;s (-42.7%) exposure to weakness in the energy sector in January was exaggerated due to the extent of its share price rally last month (when terms on its debt were successfully renegotiated). The oil price fell slightly as US rig count spiked and threatened to offset some of Opec&rsquo;s efforts to restrict supply. Other fund holdings in the sector include BP (-7.2%), Ensign Energy Services (-4.5%) and Total (-3.6%).</p>
        <p>Within a weak global telecoms sector Bezeq&rsquo;s (-20.9%) share performance was not helped by the state competition authority&rsquo;s request that the former monopoly halt measures to merge its various mobile and fixed-line businesses pending the result of a review. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Seagate Technology (+16.1%), SATS (+9.7%) and Ashmore Group (+9.7%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Fred Olsen Energy (-42.7%), Bezeq (-20.9%) and Vtech Holdings (-8.4%).</p>

        <p>&bull; Past performance is not a guide to future performance. &bull; Do remember that the value of an investment and the income from it can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.&nbsp; &bull; The European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio which could mean that it will be volatile when compared to its benchmark. &bull; The Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.</p>

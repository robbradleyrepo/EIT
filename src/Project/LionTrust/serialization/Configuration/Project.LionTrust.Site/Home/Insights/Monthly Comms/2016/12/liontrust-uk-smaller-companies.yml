        <p><strong>For investment professionals only<br />
        <br />
        </strong></p>
        <p>The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned -1.3%* in October, compared with the -1.8% return from the FTSE Small Cap excluding investment trusts index.</p>
        <p >The weak return of the FTSE Small Cap Index in October was in keeping with fairly subdued returns from global equities as macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns dominated thoughts, the US election being the most prominent source of uncertainty. The FTSE100&rsquo;s 1.0% return was slightly anomalous in this context, boosted by a 4.2% trade-weighted depreciation of sterling as &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo; talk intensified.</p>
        <br />
        <p >The Fund was not immune to this small-cap weakness, but recorded a small outperformance of the index which was helped by strong newsflow on certain holdings. Arbuthnot Banking (+17.4%), for example, enjoyed a strong rally following a third quarter trading update. The company announced a &pound;45m shareholder return by way of a &pound;3/share special dividend. The windfall relates to a bumper first half of the year, which saw the company add &pound;225m to its capital base after disposing of part of its holding in Secure Trust Bank, and completing the sale of the Everyday Loans business.</p>
        <p >Outsourced fund administration provider Sanne Group (+14.9%) announced a move into the strategically important US market via the acquisition of FLSV Fund Administration Services for a cash and shares consideration of around &pound;40m. Investors have fretted about the impact of Brexit on the group given the services it provides to a wide range of key EU jurisdictions, but for now these concerns appear to have taken a back seat and the shares moved higher.</p>
        <p >RWS Holdings (+14.1%) is a provider of patent translation and other intellectual property support services. The company announced it has enjoyed its &ldquo;best year ever&rdquo; with revenues to be at least &pound;122m, up some 28% from 2015. Last year it completed a transformational deal to acquire US based CTi, a provider of linguistic validation in the life sciences niche. The deal has proven well-timed given the predominantly dollar based revenues CTi contributes.</p>
        <p >In terms of the portfolio&rsquo;s detractors during October, shares in data intelligence specialist GB Group (-29.3%) were among the largest. A trading statement from the company showed relatively robust levels of activity, with year-on-year revenue growth of 16%. However, the shares&rsquo; relatively high rating left them susceptible to investors focusing on the negatives within the statement: only 9% of growth was organic. Had the roll-out of the new GOV.UK Verify service not been delayed, the organic growth contribution would have been higher; GB Group now needs a strong second half in order to hit its full-year forecasts.</p>
        <p >Another heavy detractor from the Fund&rsquo;s performance during October was geospatial data software and services specialist 1Spatial (-33.3%). The company released interim results to July which showed a 60% increase in revenue (aided by the acquisition of Enables IT last year) but a 67% reduction in adjusted EBITDA as contract delays hit the timing of revenue recognition in its higher margin core Geospatial division. Although the house broker maintained guidance for the full year, the market was spooked by a now-heavy H2 weighting to the forecasts, as well as a halving in the company&rsquo;s net cash balance over the half year.</p>
        <p >IT managed service provider Redcentric (-16.6%) slipped back in the absence of any news during October. However, post month-end the group released a highly disappointing update, explaining that accounting misstatements had been discovered on the balance sheet and that significant write downs of historic profits are now likely, while the net debt position is much higher than originally reported. The board has removed the company&rsquo;s CFO and commenced a forensic review of the accounts. Although the company indicated its belief that all issues relate to prior periods, the shares were hit very hard by the announcement and the company&rsquo;s inability to clarify the impact with confidence in the short term. The stock&rsquo;s position in the Fund currently remains under review in light of these unforeseen circumstances.</p>
        <p >Two positions were added during the month: Gateley Holdings and Kainos.</p>
        <p >Gateley Holdings is a commercial law firm with national scale which we believe gives it an Economic Advantage&nbsp;intangible asset in the form of a strong distribution network. It also has several other desirable characteristics&nbsp;which our investment process looks for in companies: strong customer relationships, a well-known national&nbsp;brand, and many partners (not just management) own equity in the firm.</p>
        <p >Kainos Group is an independent digital technology company with three separate strands to its business. The&nbsp;largest of these is the provision of outsourced IT design and support services to the public sector, benefitting&nbsp;heavily from the UK government&rsquo;s agenda to digitise public services. The firm also provides mobile-enabled healthcare solutions to the NHS via its Evolve software, while its third leg is involved in providing implementation and support to fast-growing US ERP software provider Workday as its only European boutique partner. Possessing strong know-how in software development, Kainos has used internal resources to develop IP-rich software products which are increasingly profitable and also provide the company with a sticky data-driven distribution network advantage.</p>

        <p >Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Investment in the Fund carries the risk of potential total loss of capital. Some smaller companies may be less liquid than larger companies and the price swings in smaller company funds may therefore be greater than in larger company funds.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Fund’s A5 share class returned -22.3%* in euro terms in March. This Fund’s target benchmark, the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index, returned -21.3%.</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Financial markets experienced sharp declines reminiscent of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) as coronavirus cases continued to escalate around the world. A number of countries entered lockdown and the human and economic costs of the virus began to mount. Trading was extremely volatile; the VIX “fear index” rose to its highest post-GFC level, sharp downward moves forced equity market circuit breakers into action and selling became indiscriminate.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>In the MSCI Europe Index, the worst performing sectors were financials (-24.3%), real estate (-22.6%) and industrials (-20.2%), whilst the most resilient were health care (-1.9%) and consumer staples (-5.1%). </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the sharp decline in oil prices (Brent crude -55%, hitting its lowest level since March 2002) put an additional strain on equities. This resulted from a combination of reduced demand during the coronavirus crisis and Saudi Arabia’s decision to ramp up production after OPEC and its partners failed to agree on measures to restrict output. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Having learned lessons from the GFC, central banks were quick to introduce emergency measures, including interest rate cuts, quantitative easing and liquidity support. Governments soon followed with huge fiscal packages aimed at supporting health care systems, businesses which have been materially impacted by the outbreak and individuals. These policies did steady markets from their initial panic, but until lockdowns are eased and businesses are open to operate as normal again, investors are likely to remain on edge</span><span>.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">The Fund suffered a significant decline, in line with the market. London-listed housebuilder <strong>Vistry Group </strong>(-56.1%), online property portal <strong>Rightmove </strong>(-23.3%) and</span><span style="color: black;"> </span><span style="color: black;">masonry materials manufacturer <strong>Forterra </strong>(-47.3%) were three of the worst hit stocks as the UK </span><span style="color: black;">government moved to bring the housing market to an effective standstill by stopping estate agents from marketing new properties and banks from lending mortgages. </span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">Forterra added that it has halted all operations and suspended its 2019 dividend given the uncertain impact from Covid-19. However, the group highlighted a strong balance sheet with a net debt/EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) multiple of 0.6.</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>The series of lockdowns across the world also put pressure on books and stationery retailer <strong>WH Smith</strong> (-42.3%), which has a significant presence in airports and train stations. In a mid-March update, the group warned that revenue in the year to end August 2020 would face a hit of £100m-£130m and underlying pre-tax profit would be £30m-£40m lower as a result of significantly less high street and travel footfall. As the crisis worsened through March, investors took the view that even these forecasts would prove too optimistic.</span></p>
        <p style="background: white;"><span style="color: black;">Currently our 12 month outlook is positive. This may seem perverse given the unambiguously down-trending markets we now face. However, the sell-off has been so severe that it has propelled our equally weighted valuation measure of markets to very cheap levels both in Europe and the US. In markets where valuations have hit these extreme levels, historic analysis suggest that downtrends tend not to persist. Such a combination is in fact predictive of the best market returns – albeit with high volatility in returns.</span></p>
        <p style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black;">In addition, we noted that the valuation measure of the best quintile of cash flow companies has sunk to levels last seen at the depths of the GFC and the tech bubble. Historically, this has subsequently generated the most attractive returns to the process we have in our records, as the valuations of attractive cash flow companies revert to more normal levels.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><em><span>While several stocks generated positive attribution relative to the index, none was in positive territory on a total return basis</span></em></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Negative contributors to performance included:</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Vistry Group (-56.1%), BW Offshore (-54.3%) and Forterra (-47.3%).</span></p>

        <p style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.5pt; text-align: start;"><span style="color: #222222;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The Liontrust European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio of stocks, if the price of one of these stocks should move significantly, this may have a notable effect on the value of the respective portfolio. The Liontrust Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.&nbsp;</span></p>

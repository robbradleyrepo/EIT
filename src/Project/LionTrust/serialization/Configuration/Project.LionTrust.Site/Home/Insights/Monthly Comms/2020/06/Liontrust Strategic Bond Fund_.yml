        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust Strategic Bond Fund returned 1.7%* in sterling terms in May. The average return from the IA Sterling Strategic Bond sector, the Fund’s comparator benchmark, was 2.2%. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Year-to-date the Fund has returned -1.0% compared to the -0.5% average return in the IA Sterling Strategic Bond sector and the -1.2% return from the median fund in the sector. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><strong><span>Market backdrop<br /><br /></span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>During the Covid19 crisis there has been a rapid onslaught of economic news and policy developments, both on the monetary and fiscal front. As part of our ongoing investment process and discipline we undertook our quarterly formal strategy review to ensure we were not missing any information arising from key economic and market indicators. Rather than reinvent the wheel, this market backdrop is the executive summary of </span><a href="https://www.liontrust.co.uk/what-we-think/blogs/gfi-quarterly-reasons-to-be-cheerful-as-well-as-fearful"><span style="color: #34b233;">our late May strategy output</span></a><span>.</span></p>
        <p><span>The economic backdrop is undoubtedly dire but, as lockdowns are being eased around the globe, there are reasons to be cheerful as well as fearful.</span></p>
        <p><span>The recovery will be uneven by geography and extremely uneven by sector. Forecasts shows real global GDP in 2020 falling by 4.5-5%; developed markets are expected to shrink in aggregate by 6.5-7% in 2020, whereas the collective figures for emerging markets are in the vicinity of a 1-1.5% contraction.</span></p>
        <p><span>There has been an extraordinary policy response to the crisis from the monetary and fiscal authorities, both in terms of size and speed: we have seen year-on-year central bank balance sheet growth of over US$4.5 trillion already. The ruling by the German Constitutional Court against the PSPP bond buying program is a stumbling block on the monetary policy side, which will hopefully be overcome.</span></p>
        <p><span>On the European fiscal front, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Angela Merkel have proposed a €500 billion EU recovery fund, showing a desire for greater European cohesion.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>US politics also creates risks, with 2020 a presidential election year. Tensions between the US and China are increasing and a descent back into a trade war would create a major headwind for economic recovery. We hope Trump remembers the key electoral factor – “it’s the economy, stupid”.</span></p>
        <p><span>The speed and extent of the recovery are partly determined by how deeply scarred economies are by the crisis and lockdown. In the US, over 30 million jobs have been cumulatively lost, with 78% of them viewed as being temporary layoffs. Furthermore, there has been a jump in the savings rate; when this unwinds, it will create a large demand impulse. Added to this, a low oil price naturally adds a boost to other consumption.</span></p>
        <p><span>We are positioned for the survival of the system and a gradual recovery, but not a V-shaped recovery. Real GDP is expected to be lower at the end of 2021 than it was in 2019.</span></p>
        <p><span>Rates markets are very expensive and rigged to ensure that investors lose real spending power in a classic case of financial repression. With an enormous amount of supply to absorb, and the associated fractured government finances, yields should be much higher, but central banks simply will not allow this.</span></p>
        <p><span>Some companies’ top lines will be fine this year, but very few will avoid margin pressure due to alternative working practices. Dividends will continue to be cut and share buybacks suspended as balance sheet strength and servicing debt – paying our mandatory coupons – is prioritised.</span></p>
        <p><span>Investment grade spreads have retraced a large portion of their widening, yet still offer compelling value for the long-term investor. High yield has not proportionately recovered as much of the spread widening as investment grade, and we therefore advocate spending more of the funds’ risk budgets on the high yield opportunity. We remain highly stock and sector selective and are positioned in those sectors that can withstand a prolonged economic malaise.</span></p>
        <p><span><strong><span>Rates</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>The Fund has retained its longstanding low beta duration strategy, finishing May at 3.0 years</span><span><sup><span>†</span></sup></span><span> of exposure, compared to a neutral level of 4.5 years. With central banks firmly anchoring the short end of their respective government’s yield curves, we have seen some long end steepening due to the combination of enormous supply and the nascent economic recovery. We have been saying that longer-dated government bonds looked vulnerable; now that this has proved to be the case, we have reduced the size of our US curve steepener by rotating one year’s worth of shorter dated duration exposure into the 30-year area.</span></p>
        <p><span>The US remains our favoured rates market, but this should really be viewed as the best of a bad bunch. Within the US, we believe Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) offer good value; these represent approximately 0.75 years of duration. The Covid-19 crisis is clearly disinflationary due to the demand shock, but as the recovery takes hold one should expect prices to rebound; with breakevens at less than 1.2%, TIPS are very cheap inflation insurance for bond portfolios. We continue to take advantage of shorting Canadian government debt relative to the US to generate incremental alpha; the Fund finished May 0.5 years short Canada.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>In Europe, we took profits on our long France versus Germany position. The Macron/Merkel €500bn initial proposal was followed by an EC drafted €750bn Next Generation EU fund; there will be political horse trading, but these signs of cohesion caused the French/German bond spread to tighten. This leaves the Fund with approximately half a year of euro duration, partly offsetting a quarter year short in the UK.</span></p>
        <p><span><strong><span>Allocation</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>The Fund continues to be significantly exposed to credit having made a large asset allocation increase during the crisis. The combined weighting is approximately 85%, split between 57.5% investment grade and 27.5% high yield (note that 10% of the high yield exposure is through a CDS index overlay using iTraxx Xover).&nbsp; After a strong rally in May we did a little trim of the Xover exposure and we are looking to replace this allocation with exposure to physical bonds. The basis, the difference between the credit spread on credit default swaps compared to physical bonds, is a large negative – meaning that physical bonds offer a better premium for investors.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p><span>Towards the end of May, the Fund implemented a low risk relative value trade, using credit default swap indices that naturally mean revert. The position is being long risk CDX IG, the US investment grade CDS index, versus short risk iTraxx Europe, the European investment grade comparator (this index is often referred to as “Main”).&nbsp; The entry point was +10 basis points spread differential with a 0.75 years position sizing on each leg; we’d look to take profits if this gets close to zero, thereby generating high single digits basis points profit.</span></p>
        <p><span><strong><span>Selection</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Stock selection has continued to be strong in May as our preference for companies with resilient business models has led to an avoidance of the sectors and companies most impacted by the Covid-19 crisis. At the riskier end of the Fund’s holding spectrum, there was a continued recovery in the price of <strong>Neptune</strong> energy’s bonds; a combination of positive results and a cheap exit from a previously agreed asset purchase has made investors realise the flexibility the company has. </span></p>
        <p><span>Another strong contributor was <strong>Allfunds</strong>, whose bonds had fallen to the low 80s (cents in the Euro) on what appeared to be close to zero trading in the bonds. They are now back around par, showing the benefit of having the confidence to not panic out of positions in a crisis. Trading activity was low in high yield; we added to <strong>DaVita,</strong> the US renal care specialist, and trimmed some of cable company <strong>UPC</strong>’s bonds.</span></p>
        <p><span>Investment grade issuance year to date has gone through the US$1trillion level, which is due to the natural reaction by corporates to seek long-term liquidity and banks to fund their ballooning balance sheets. The majority of the issuance is presently pricing in line with where bonds are trading in the secondary market. We are being very selective about which deals we participate in as we work on the basis that they need to offer enough upside to supplant an existing holding in the Fund. Two that appealed during May happened to both be euro denominated: conventional <strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> bonds and a dated subordinated (lower tier 2) bond from <strong>Allianz</strong>.&nbsp; In the secondary market, the Fund bought exposure to <strong>Origin Energy</strong>, an integrated Australian energy company whose bonds were oversold. The market was focussing too much on the upstream energy business and not enough on the retail gas and electricity distribution that provide the company with a large amount of stability. Holdings in <strong>CVS</strong>, the US pharmacy, and <strong>Philip Morris </strong>both offered limited further upside and were sold to make way for these new purchases.</span></p>

Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

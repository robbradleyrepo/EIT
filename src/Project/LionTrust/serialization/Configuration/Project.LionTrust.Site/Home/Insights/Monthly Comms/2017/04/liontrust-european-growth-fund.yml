        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund returned 4.7%* in sterling terms in March, compared with the 4.5% return from the MSCI Europe ex-UK index.</strong></p>
        <p>The rally seen in stock markets in recent months continued strongly in March with the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index rising 3.5% in sterling terms. While the UK formally triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon and subsequently started the negotiation process for the UK‘s exit from the European Union, this had been well flagged and largely discounted by markets. Instead, investors in Europe focused on increasingly positive macro data. This included strong PMI data, a narrowing of the output gap, and the interpretation by some market participants of a less dovish tone in comments from ECB President Mario Draghi.</p>
        <p>In the US, investors increasingly looked for evidence that the president can deliver on the election rhetoric for improved growth and infrastructure spend. The healthcare reform debacle (the failure by Trump to repeal Barack Obama’s healthcare law) did little to ease investors’ rising concerns. On the central bank front, the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates by 25 basis points as expected but the Federal Open Market Committee maintained its median estimate of three rate increases in total for 2017, slightly more dovish than some in the market anticipated.</p>
        <p>Sector performance was positive across the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index, with the rise led by utilities (+7.8%), financials (+6.7%) and consumer discretionary (+5.2%). The weakest performing sectors included real estate (+1.6%), consumer staples (+2.1%) and health care (+2.4%).</p>
        <p>One of the Fund’s financials sector holdings, Deutsche Pfandbriefbank (+16.4%), was a large riser in the month. The company released 2016 results in which income was boosted by the release of write-downs. Consolidated pre-tax profit rose 54% year-on-year though net interest income rose slipped by 5%. The German bank, which specialises in real estate and public sector financing, expects 2017 profit before tax to be in-line with 2016. Banks were the best performing sub-sector within financials, rising 10.7%; Banco BPM (+17.1%) and Mediobanca (+11.5%) also participated in the sector strength. Swiss manufacturer Forbo Holding (+11.1%) was another holding to post strong 2016 results in March. The company, whose products include floor coverings and conveyer belts, reported net sales growth of 4.1% amid challenging market conditions and lifted its dividend by 12%. Forbo noted that market conditions in 2017 are likely to be unchanged from 2016 and it expects to post a slight increase in net sales and profit. </p>
        <p>Looking further down the portfolio’s contributors list in March, Straumann Holdings’s share price staged a steady recovery (+8.5%) having initially fallen in response to full-year results in mid-February. The manufacturer of dental implants, instruments, prosthetics and tissue regeneration products reported a 14.9% rise in revenue from 2015 and a 16.9% in gross profit. On March 1, Straumann received a favourable ruling for one of its businesses – Instradent – which had been the subject of a claim of patent infringement from competitor Nobel Biocare. The US Patent Trial and Appeal Board, found that Nobel Biocare’s claims were patentable. Later in the month, Straumann signed two distribution agreements to supply 3Shape dental scanner solutions and Rapid Shape 3D-printers to dental practices and laboratories around the world. </p>
        <p>Tethys Oil (-10.6%) was hit by oil &amp; gas sector weakness as spot prices fell, with Brent crude falling 5.0% in March to just under $53 a barrel. Oriflame Holdings (-2.6%) shares edged slightly lower in March having risen substantially following its 2016 results in February, which came in slightly ahead of consensus analyst expectations. The beauty company recorded sales growth of 8% in local currency terms and 5% in euro terms. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Deutsche Pfandbriefbank (+16.4%), Forbo Holding (+11.1%), Mediobanca (+11.5%). </p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Tethys Oil (-10.6%), Oriflame Holding (-2.6%) and Nexans (-0.3%).</p>

        <p>• Past performance is not a guide to future performance. • Do remember that the value of an investment and the income from it can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.&nbsp;• Some of the Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team invest in smaller companies. These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. • The European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio which could mean that it will be volatile when compared to its benchmark. • The Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.</p>

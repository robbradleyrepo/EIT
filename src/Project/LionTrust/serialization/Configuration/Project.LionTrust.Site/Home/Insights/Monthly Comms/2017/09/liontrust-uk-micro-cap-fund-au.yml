        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned 0.1%* in August. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index returned -0.7%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned 2.8% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was 1.6%.</strong></p>
        <p>In a light month for newsflow on portfolio holdings, the Fund made a flat return as a fairly even distribution of share price returns cancelled themselves out. In fact, plotting the holdings’ monthly returns on a chart might approximate a normal distribution centred on 0%: 30 holdings delivered a positive return, 29 were in negative territory, while a handful were unchanged.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of the gainers, the largest was <strong>Bioquell</strong> (+26.1%) which in late July had announced interim results showing 19% growth in revenues to £14.3m. Stripping out declining sales from its Defence business, growth from its Bio-decontamination products and services was 27%. This top-line growth was supplemented by an improvement in margins, leading to profit before tax more than trebling to £1.4m. It also stated that business momentum has led it to believe that full year profit before tax will exceed current market expectations. The company is at an inflexion point in its transition away from legacy Defence business towards Bio-decontamination. This process took another step forward in August with the disposal of its Airflow service business. It had ceased production of Airflow safety cabinets in 2013 but has supported the legacy products with service engineers and spare parts.</p>
        <p>Offsetting this was a fall in the shares of customer engagement software provider <strong>Netcall</strong> (-20.2%), which announced the acquisition of low-code software development platform MatsSoft during August. Despite the earnings accretive nature of the deal, Netcall’s shares were de-rated by the market as a trading update released in conjunction with the acquisition highlighted a profit warning in the underlying business. The company is currently undergoing a transition from a traditional licence-based revenue model to a subscription-based revenue stream. While the increased visibility of earnings post the transition will be a welcome longer-term development for the stock when viewed through the lens of the Economic Advantage investment process, short term profitability has been impacted by delayed revenue recognition on subscription sales.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Among other holdings to release newsflow was <strong>Inspired Energy</strong> (+14.4%), a recent addition to the Fund. It reported a 20% increase in revenue to £12.2m in the first six months of 2017, while the order book for its largest division increased by 60% to £41.2m. Inspired Energy is a consultancy firm which specialises in energy procurement and management for industrial and commercial clients. Customers quickly come to rely on Inspired’s energy expertise once contracted, moving the company to ‘trusted partner’ status and constituting a significant embedded distribution strength. The company also enjoys high levels of recurring income due to long contract cycles. Both of these attributes are core Economic Advantage assets.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Shares in <strong>Empresaria Group </strong>(-9.6%)<strong> </strong>slid on publication of its interim results, but only to the extent that they retraced gains made on the back of its July trading update. The recruitment company grew net fee income by 26% to £34.4m in the six months to 30 June, while adjusted profit before tax improved by 12%. The company expects to meet consensus financial expectations for the full-year statement and suggested that further bolt-on acquisitions should be expected.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Bioquell (+26.8%), Bioventix (+16.3%), Inspired Energy (+14.4%), Attraqt Group (+12.1%), Charles Stanley Group and Ideagen (+8.3%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Netcall (-20.2%), Croma Security Solutions (-17.1%), Sprue Aegis (-10.2%), IMImobile (-9.9%) and Empresaria Group (-9.6%).</p>

        <p>• Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</p>

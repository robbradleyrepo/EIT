      Value: Valeo has predicted this week that electric vehicles will comprise 10% of car sales by 2025. While this would represent major growth from the current 1%, Liontrust’s Neil Brown believes this estimate could ultimately prove to be conservative.

        <p>Anyone forced to navigate treacherous roads this morning will appreciate ongoing developments in car safety and one of the industry’s largest suppliers has just predicted a major surge in electric vehicles in the years ahead.</p>
        <p>French company Valeo offers one of the widest ranges of smart sensors and features for automated driving, including autonomous emergency braking (AEB). Speaking in the wake of its full-year results last week, Valeo chief executive Jacques&nbsp;Aschenbroich&nbsp;said at least 10% of all vehicles sold in 2025 will be electric, doubling the group’s 5-6% internal forecast last year.</p>
        <p><em>Improving auto safety </em>and <em>Improving the efficiency of cars </em>are key themes across our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=035EFDA3BC0A43D69548FC77F9116B6F&amp;_z=z"><span style="color: #34b233;">Liontrust Sustainable Future funds</span></a>&nbsp;and we see this number as still on the conservative side given the drivers for change. One of our predictions is that 100% of new cars in Europe could have AEB by 2020 for example (plus 80% in the US and 50% in China), creating a €10bn market.</p>
        <p>Electric cars currently account for less than 1% of global vehicle sales but manufacturers including Ford and Volkswagen have pledged billions in recent months to fast track programmes, with more stringent rules on CO2 emissions across Europe from 2021. </p>
        <p>A number of German cities announced plans this week to ban diesel vehicles, with Stuttgart and Dusseldorf looking to set a precedent by removing older cars from zones worst affected by pollution. While there may be legal wrangling to come, analysts have said this could lead to similar action across Europe in the face of tightening regulations.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        <span>This comes after Nissan recently predicted a turning point for car buyers in the middle of the next decade. The Japanese carmaker said prices of battery vehicles and traditional cars will draw level in 2025 and end the need for government subsidies that currently support the majority of electric car sales.</span></p>

        <p><strong>Key Risks</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital.</strong> The issue of units/shares in Liontrust Funds may be subject to an initial charge, which will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term. Investments should always be considered as long term.</p>
        <p>Some of the Funds managed by the Sustainable Future Equities team involve foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.</p>

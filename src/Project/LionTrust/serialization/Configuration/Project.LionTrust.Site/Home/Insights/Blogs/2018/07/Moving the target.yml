        <p><strong><span>The recently launched <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DA9CE397794849C29704872C3265F305&amp;_z=z"><span style="color: #34b233;">Liontrust GF High Yield Bond Fund</span></a>&nbsp;is setting a new performance target not based on the traditional high yield indices.</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>We appreciate, of course, that investors find reference to traditional benchmarks useful, mainly for communication purposes, but after that, we find indices, from an investment perspective, aren&rsquo;t particularly useful. </span></p>
        <p><span>We run a relatively concentrated portfolio compared to our peers and happily choose to have little or no holdings in particular sectors. Good credit work combined with running a relatively concentrated portfolio feeds into long investment holding periods, thereby reducing the relatively high trading costs associated with high yield corporate bonds. </span></p>
        <p><span>Potential high yield investors might be tempted to employ a passive strategy &ndash; managers have for the most part tended to underperform their benchmarks over longer periods. However, savers cannot practicably invest in the typical high yield indices, such as the BAML ICE range. </span></p>
        <p><span>One of the main reasons for this is the natural state of turnover in these indices combined with the aforementioned cost of trading. The index data have frictionless trading, managers do not. </span></p>
        <p><span>ETFs, a popular &lsquo;passive&rsquo; option for investors, have a similar problem. Compared to the traditional indices used by the high yield market, ETFs don&rsquo;t get even close to their long-term performance. Over the last five years for example, the iShares Global High Yield ETF has produced returns of 3.8% a year compared to 5.6% for the BAML Global High Yield index (Source: iShares, to 17.07.18). </span></p>
        <p><span>ETFs sensibly compare their own performance against a customised benchmark that cherry picks liquidity. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think this is a sensible thing for them to do. The advertised relative performance looks to be doing a good job, but the comparison with active managers on relative performance is really comparing the apple with the proverbial pear.</span></p>
        <span>We will provide clients with management information based on the traditional indices. In terms of investment performance, however, our target is to outperform the iShares Global High Yield ETF by 1.5% a year net of fees over the long term.</span>

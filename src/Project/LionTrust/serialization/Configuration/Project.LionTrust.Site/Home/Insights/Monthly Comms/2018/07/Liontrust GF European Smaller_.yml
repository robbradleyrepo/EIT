        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>The Fund’s A5 share class returned -3.8%* in euro terms in June (A4 share class -3.9%). This compares with the -1.1% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index</span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The threat of a trade war once again weighed on European equities. China and the US were unable to come to a trade agreement and soon after negotiations ended President Trump confirmed tariffs of 25% on US$50bn worth of Chinese imports. China outlined retaliatory actions and both sides threatened to increase these proposed measures. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The exchange of hostilities hit sentiment in European markets, causing a clear defensive tilt. Utilities (+1.8%) was the best performing sector in the MSCI Europe Index in euro terms, with consumer staples (+1.3%) and health care (+0.8%) also strong gainers. The one traditionally defensive sector to underperform was telecoms (-0.7%), but was still some way off consumer discretionary (-4.8%), which was the biggest laggard.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>There was also significant central bank news this month. The US Federal Reserve raised its target for the Fed Funds rate by 25bps to 1.75%-2.0%. The Federal Open Market Committee’s forecast of future interest rates showed it expects to hike rates twice more in 2018, once more than the guidance given in March. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The European Central Bank (ECB) unveiled plans to wind down quantitative easing. The bank stated that its monthly asset purchases will fall from €30bn to €15bn in September 2018 and then end in December 2018, though interest rates were unlikely to change until at least summer 2019. The decision preceded the latest inflation data for the eurozone. Annual CPI in June was estimated to be 2.0%, up from 1.9% in May and largely in line with the ECB’s target of close to, but below, 2%. However, core inflation – which strips out volatile items such as energy and food - remained sluggish and slipped to 1.0% from 1.1% in May. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Of the Fund’s holdings,<strong> ERAMET </strong>(-24.9%) was one of the disappointments, mainly due to the risk-off environment. The alloy metal company’s shares came under pressure after its takeover of Mineral Deposits Limited (MDL) came into difficulty. MDL’s major shareholders announced that they will act in unison and believe that the price initially offered by ERAMET was too low. ERAMET later in June proposed an improved offer of A$1.75 per MDL share, up from A$1.46.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Royal Unibrew </span></strong><span>(+11.2%) delivered a positive surprise by upgrading its earnings guidance for the current year. Due to unseasonably good weather in Northern Europe, and a faster than expected integration of its Terme di Crodo acquisition, the brewer raised its earnings before interest and tax forecast to DKK 1.19-1.27 billion from DKK 1.09-1.19 billion. Net revenue forecasts were also adjusted slightly higher to DKK 6.80-7.00 billion from DKK 6.65-6.90 billion.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>For the rest of the portfolio, newsflow was in short supply during June and major stock movements were mainly driven by investor sentiment. Global chipmakers were hurt by escalating trade war concerns. <strong>Siltronic</strong> (-15.2%) was among them, particularly because of its Asian exposure (68% of revenue in 2017). <strong>Ferrexpo</strong> (-17.1%) was part of an underperforming materials sector (-2.1%) after a rise in the dollar had the inverse effect on commodity prices and hit miners.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Meanwhile, gambling company <strong>888 Holdings </strong>(-10.7%) gave up the gains it made in May, when the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law which banned sports betting in the entire country. Other poor performers in the consumer space were <strong>CIE Automotive </strong>(-11.8%) and <strong>Scandic Hotels Group </strong>(-11.5%). </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>There were a few delayed changes made to the Fund’s holding as a result of our annual review. Norwegian offshore drilling company <strong>Fred Olsen Energy</strong> was sold while London-listed <strong>Restaurant Group</strong>, which owns chains such as Frankie &amp; Benny’s and Chiquito, was added. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Positive contributors to performance included:</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Ence Energía y Celulosa (+12.8%), Royal Unibrew (+11.2%) and Tethys Oil (+9.2%)</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Negative contributors to performance included:</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>ERAMET (-24.9%), Ferrexpo (-17.1%) and Siltronic (-15.2%)</span></p>

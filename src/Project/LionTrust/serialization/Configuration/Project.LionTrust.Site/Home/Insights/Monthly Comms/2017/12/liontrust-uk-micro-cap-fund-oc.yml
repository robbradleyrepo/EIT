        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned 1.9%* in October. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index returned 1.7%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned 3.6% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was 3.5%.</strong></p>
        <p>One of the best returns this month was delivered by email marketing automation software provider <strong>dotdigital Group </strong>(+27.0%) which reported a 30% jump in pretax profit for the year to end June 2017, along with a 19% rise in revenue. As one of the intangible assets we look for in companies, we were pleased to see recurring revenue increased to 81% from 78% last year. Milan Patel, the company’s chief executive, added that the first few months of the company’s new financial year have been in line with expectations and the market continues to grow robustly.</p>
        <p><strong>Learnings Technologies Group </strong>(+19.3%) saw its shares appreciate at the beginning of the month after it announced in a short statement that the financial impact from one of its major contracts will be accelerated in 2017. This will mean that financial results for 2017 will be ahead of expectations. The statement followed a strong set of interim results in September, which showed a 68% increase in revenue to £21.5m<strong>. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Vianet Group </strong>(+15.2%) announced the acquisition of enterprise resource planning and mobile software company Vendman Systems for £4.3m. Management said the purchase will create significant cross-selling opportunities and will enhance earnings in financial year 2019. However, <strong>Netcall </strong>(-18.6%) remained under pressure as investors digested the impact of its acquisition of low code software development platform MatsSoft back in August. The acquisition coincided with an underlying downgrade to analyst forecasts as the customer engagement software company transitions to a software as a service revenue from a traditional licence based model.</p>
        <p><strong>ATTRAQT Group</strong> (-24.4%) and <strong>Solid State </strong>(-10.8%) were both hit after they warned on earnings<strong>.</strong> ATTRAQT, which provides site search, visual merchandising and personalised product recommendation software to online retailers, stated that revenue for its full-year will be around 10% lower than previously expected. This announcement was made after an in depth review by new finance director Eric Dodd found inaccuracies in forecasting the timing of certain contracts and client “go live” dates. Meanwhile, supplier of specialist industrial and ruggedized technology Solid State stated that as a result of product mix and increase in overhead costs in the six months to end September, pre-tax profit for the full year is expected to be lower than current market forecasts. Despite the weaker than expected profit margin, top line trends were encouraging with the company expecting to report a 12% rise in revenue for the six months to end September.</p>
        <p><strong>James Cropper</strong>’s<strong> </strong>(-12.8%) shares declined after it reiterated that the increase in pulp prices was impacting its paper business but maintained that other businesses are trading well and is confident of meeting expectations for the current financial year. <strong>Inspired Energy </strong>(-12.0%) was also a detractor this month after it announced the resignation of its chief executive due to personal reasons. </p>
        <p>Smartphone and tablet app developer<strong> Crimson Tide</strong> (+14.4%) was another contributor after it announced a series of long term contract wins valued at £350,000. The contract wins came after a strong set of interim results in September which showed a 32% rise in revenue and 16% increase in profit before tax. <strong>CML Microsystems </strong>(+15.6%) shares attracted interest after it released a short statement ahead of its interim results in November stating revenue and operating profit were in line with expectations and significantly ahead of the same period last year. </p>
        <p>There was one portfolio change to note in October with Quarto Group exiting the Fund as management ownership fell below our 3% requirement. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p>dotdigital Group (+27.0%), Learnings Technologies Group (+19.3%), CML Microsystems (+15.6%), Vianet Group (+15.2%) and Crimson Tide (+14.4%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p>ATTRAQT Group (-24.4%), Netcall (-18.6%), James Cropper (-12.8%), Inspired Energy (-12.0%) and Solid State (-10.8%).</p>

        • Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.

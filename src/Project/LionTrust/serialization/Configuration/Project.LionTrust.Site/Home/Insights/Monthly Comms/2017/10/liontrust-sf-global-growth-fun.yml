        <p><strong>The Fund outperformed its benchmark and peer group over Q3, registering returns of 3.99% against 1.50% from the MSCI World Index and the IA Global sector average of 1.53% *.</strong></p>
        <p>Our process targets businesses that can grow structurally, driven by the shift towards a global economy that is more efficient, provides a higher quality of life and is more resilient.</p>
        <p>In terms of individual stock drivers, ASML performed very well over the quarter. Its Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) technology dominates the market and is an important enabler of innovation within the semiconductor space. </p>
        <p>Semiconductor companies compete on their ability to offer leading-edge technology into new end markets such as autos, the Internet of Things (IOT) and Artificial Intelligence. Many of these innovative chips help deliver a more efficient global economy, particularly where the use of scarce resources is concerned, and ASML benefits from this efficiency trend.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Keyence also performed well over the quarter. This company is the global leader in automated control equipment, which improves the efficiency of factory equipment – and therefore helps make the global economy more efficient. Keyence’s equipment can be added to a production line to automate the process, increasing throughput and reducing product defects and wastage. Keyence has a high market share in Japan and has been growing quickly in the US, Europe and China. The opportunity in China is very exciting, given the desire to improve the efficiency of the country’s manufacturing sector. </p>
        <p>Alexion was another strong contributor over the quarter, which was particularly pleasing given our conviction call to add to the position in Q1 despite significant underperformance over the previous 12 months. The core business for Alexion ensures treatments for patients suffering from various ultra-rare diseases related to the kidney. Without this treatment, these patients – many of whom are young children – would not survive. </p>
        <p>Many of Alexion’s issues related to a management team that made errors in the early stages of the company’s growth as an orphan drug business and we were pleased a respected CEO came in to take over. The company’s products genuinely solve unmet medical needs, providing a higher quality of life, to patients otherwise burdened with fatal and debilitating diseases.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>On the negative side, Acuity Brands was a poor performer in Q3. After improved returns over the second quarter, doubts emerged around the company’s ability to continue its recent growth pattern. This is due to pressure at the low end of the LED market from Chinese competitors and the potential that LED penetration may be higher than previously thought. </p>
        <p>LED lighting is an exciting technology that can reduce the energy used in buildings and homes significantly and Acuity is a high-quality business that distributes these products. The issue is that, as penetration of LED increases, Acuity Brands will grow at the market rate rather than at a much higher rate. This in turn puts pressure on the company’s valuation. </p>

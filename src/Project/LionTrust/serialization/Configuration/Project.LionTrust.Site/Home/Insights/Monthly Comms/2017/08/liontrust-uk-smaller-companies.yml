        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned 2.9%* in July, compared with the 3.1% return from the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index.</strong></p>
        <p>Small cap stocks made strong returns in the month as Q2 earnings season kicked off. In the Fund, <strong>Keywords Studios </strong>(+51.2%) delivered the best return following the release of its half year trading update. The company, which provides technical services to the video games industry, stated revenue for the six months to 30 June was up 50% year-on-year, while adjusted pre-tax profit was up 60%. Keywords also highlighted that strong cash generation and a new credit facility leaves it well placed to complete further selective acquisitions in the remainder of the year. </p>
        <p>Mobile payments company <strong>Bango </strong>(+33.7%) stated in a trading update ahead of its interim results that costs and revenue were in line with management expectations for the first half of 2017. It added that its end user spend rate exceeded £300m per year at the end of June, compared to £195m per year at the end of December 2016. <strong>Quixant </strong>(+18.5%) shares rose before its second quarter update was released at the end of July. The gaming platform designer and manufacturer noted that trading in the first six months of 2017 was “stronger than previously anticipated”. It expects to report revenue of US$56m, which would be an improvement on the US$41.3m it made at the half year stage in 2016. </p>
        <p>Away from second quarter trading statements, <strong>Tracsis </strong>(+17.9%) announced that it had been awarded a significant contract for the provision of its software planning products by a major UK rail operator. The contract, which will be delivered over four years, underpins the company’s confidence for the future and the lack of any negative news during the update should bode well for upcoming final results. <sub></sub></p>
        <p>Of the Fund’s detractors, <strong>Quarto Group </strong>delivered a total return of (-43.6%) after it warned that its guidance for 2017 and beyond had been set too high. The illustrated book publishing group added that its interim results will show lower than expected trading, reflecting the ongoing soft retail environment. Investment management company <strong>Brooks MacDonald </strong>(-14.8%) fell after newly installed CEO Catherine Connellan announced the company was set to see increasing costs due to upcoming additional regulation, to the detriment of margins, as well as unhelpfully revealing a £6.5m charge related to legacy matters from its former Channel Islands-based Spearpoint business. On the positive side, the group noted that its capital position remains strong as it recording a 26% annual rise in funds under management at the end of June.</p>
        <p><strong>Pennant International’s </strong>(-13.9%) shares declined despite the company stating that it has not seen any loss of confidence among its customer base as a result of Brexit uncertainty and its results for the first half of 2017 are on track to come in line with the market’s expectations. It also noted new contract wins and extensions in the period with Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Japan, HMRC and others. <strong>Medica Group</strong> (-7.7%) gave up some of its post IPO gains, despite the company noting in an AGM statement at the end of June that it remains on track to meet the Board’s expectations for 2017 full-year results.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>In terms of portfolio activity, <strong>Sanne Group</strong> was sold from the Fund as management’s holding in the company fell below our required threshold of 3%. We initiated positions in <strong>PROACTIS Holdings</strong> and <strong>Tatton Asset Management</strong>. PROACTIS Group, which provides enterprise grade spend management software to both commercial and the public sector, possess all three economic advantage assets we look for; recurring revenue over 70% of turnover, intellectual property and a strong data-driven distribution channels. We took the opportunity to invest during a £70m placing of new stock to help fund its acquisition of US competitor Perfect Commerce. The deal catapults the group to a top-six global position in ePurchasing solutions and as well as commercial synergies, is expected to lead to considerable operational improvements with corresponding upgrades. </p>
        <p>Tatton Asset Management, which undertook an Initial Public Offering early in the month, offers regulatory compliance and business consulting services, as well as a whole-of-market mortgage provision to directly authorised financial advisers across the UK. In addition it has a disruptive, low cost, on-platform only discretionary fund management offering, which has enjoyed rapid growth in assets under management since it was established in 2013. The company is benefiting from general industry tail-winds as the population is increasingly in need of financial advice due to the ever more complex tax system, and its compliance network provides a solution for IFAs struggling with the burden of regulation. With revenue generated predominantly from subscription and annual fees, the business has high contracted recurring revenue while management still holds a considerable amount of stock.</p>

        <p> • Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</p>

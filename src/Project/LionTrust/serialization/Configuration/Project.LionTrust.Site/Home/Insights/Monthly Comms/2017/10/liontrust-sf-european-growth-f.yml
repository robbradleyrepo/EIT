        <p><strong>The Fund rose 3.69% over the third quarter of 2017, outperforming the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index&rsquo;s 3.53%*.</strong></p>
        <p>Our process targets businesses that can grow structurally, driven by the shift towards a global economy that is more efficient, provides a higher quality of life and is more resilient.</p>
        <p>Our position in Netherlands-based company ASML performed well over the period. ASML is the dominant supplier of lithography equipment to the global semiconductor industry, with a 75% market share. The company focuses on research and development of the next generation of lithography and is developing a new technology called Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV). </p>
        <p>ASML is a beneficiary of our Improving the efficiency of energy use theme, enabling greater energy efficiency in a number of industries including cars, the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. </p>
        <p>Once again, the Fund&rsquo;s top-performing financial holding was DNB &ndash; the Norwegian retail bank identified under our Increasing financial resilience theme with strong governance and prudent lending practices. The company is highly correlated to the price of oil due to the makeup of the Norwegian economy but also has the quality indicators we look for in banks including strong capitalisation and high returns on tangible equity. </p>
        <p>Elsewhere, Kingspan, a company exposed to our Building better homes theme, continued to perform well. The company designs and manufactures a range of advanced insulation products that enable new and old residential and non-residential buildings to retain heat and save energy. The company benefits from supportive regulation and the structural shift towards sustainable buildings, and has continued to grow revenues and expand margins over a number of years. </p>
        <p>Looking towards the European macroeconomic environment, Germany held its Federal election in late September, which saw a historic fourth win for pro-European Chancellor and moderate Angela Merkel. </p>
        <p>This provided the eurozone with further stability following the election of French moderate Emmanuel Macron although we remain cognisant of the high levels of populist vote in both countries.</p>
        <p>Another potential political risk is related to the UK&rsquo;s progress on its departure from the EU, which continues to be slow and acrimonious. With this in mind, we continue to believe holding high-quality companies with structural sustainability drivers will deliver outperformance over the long term.</p>

        <p>&bull; Liontrust SF Absolute Growth Fund and Liontrust SF Global Growth Fund have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Liontrust SF Absolute Growth Fund invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and have a concentrated portfolio of securities. There is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund&rsquo;s share price.</p>

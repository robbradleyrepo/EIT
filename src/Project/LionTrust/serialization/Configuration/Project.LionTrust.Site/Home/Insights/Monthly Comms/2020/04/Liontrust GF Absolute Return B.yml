        <p class="Body" style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Liontrust GF Absolute Return Bond Fund (C5 share <span style="color: windowtext;">class) returned -3.8%* in sterling terms in Q1 2020, and t</span><span style="color: black;">he primary US dollar share class (B5) returned -3.4%.</span><span style="color: black;"> </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The Fund was designed to be able to withstand a repeat of a credit crunch event without the rolling 1-year return turning negative; unfortunately March 2020 proved to be significantly worse and the US dollar unit class is down just under 1% on a rolling 12-month basis; the sterling units are obviously down too. The credit spread widening exhibited by the Fund’s Carry Component holdings, as well as those in Selection, should see a meaningful retracement over the next few months and we are confident that the rolling 1-year absolute return will soon be positive again.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Market backdrop</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>Unprecedented is a word getting plenty of use in the current environment and with good reason given around 20% of the global population currently lives under effective lockdown conditions. With the equivalent of many years’ worth of government policy developments crammed into a month, we will aim to distil the salient points for bond markets.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Starting on monetary policy, the simplest way to picture this is that it mainly addresses the supply side shock, making sure companies and the financial system can access liquidity. In this regard access to cash is more important than the interest rate charged on said cash. Taking the US as an example, about US$550bn of committed facilities out of a US$2.5 trillion total have already been drawn down to provide companies with a liquidity buffer.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>The speed and depth of central bankers’ response to the situation has been far greater than anyone expected, clearly understanding we are in emergency territory. We have seen something of an alphabet soup of polices emerge and, without going through each one in detail, this is basically central banks throwing everything at the problem. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Most important is the fact QE (quantitative easing) is back and in style; the US effectively committed to ‘QE infinity’ and the phrase ‘whatever it takes’ was in constant use around the world over recent weeks. All the major Western countries are moving towards some kind of TARP (Troubled Assets Relief Program) but for markets as a whole rather than just the banks, as it was back in 2008/9. The Federal Reserve’s announcement that it was prepared to support the corporate bond market helped provide a much-needed fillip to a beleaguered asset class. Even with this, March 2020 was the worst month on record for corporate bond returns; before the Fed’s actions market returns were worse than September and October 2008 added together!</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Fiscal policy is the big weightlifter when it comes to the demand side of the equation and focuses on keeping companies afloat and employment going and looking after society’s most vulnerable. We have seen an invocation of crisis language and this gives governments the ability to push towards crisis levels of funding, running with large budget deficits and basically writing off 2020 as a bad economic experience while keeping companies going and employment up. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The US fiscal deficit is already at 4.5% but there is nothing to stop that climbing as high as 10%. The US$2 trillion package that passed through Congress in March may well be followed by an infrastructure bill, particularly given the 10 million rise in unemployment in the last two weeks of the month. Western economies are socialising the crisis costs and running up deficits, kicking it into the long grass for future generations’ tax revenues to deal with – and economically, that is exactly the right thing to do. The hard part is getting the money to the right areas and we would expect more fiscal developments.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The measures that have been taken will not prevent a very deep depression occurring. However, they should ensure that the worst of the downturn is cushioned for the majority of people. An economic recovery will take time to materialise, the longevity of the crisis depending on the nature of the exit strategies from the lockdowns. The key point for us is that the system will survive and, even though there is enormous uncertainty, the companies whose bonds the Fund owns will persevere and continue servicing their debt.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Credit curve inversion</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br />
        As well as the extent of the credit spread widening during the first quarter of 2020, it is also worth noting that the credit curve inverted; this means that shorter dated bonds at one stage had wider spreads than their longer dated cousins. The rationale for this was the sheer extent of forced selling by both active corporate bond funds and ETFs (exchange traded funds). Shorter dated bonds had fallen less in cash price terms and it was clear that bond investors were selling what they could to meet redemptions rather than what they wanted to.<br />
        </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center;"><img src="-/media/C7E809B8DD5347E6AFECCEDB97FC766B.ashx?h=346&amp;w=600" style="width:600px; height:346px;" alt="Crisis credit curve inversion" class="custom-image-height-auto" /></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br />
        Examining the chart above, the credit curve started the quarter with its usual upward sloping shape. At the end of February, the situation was still benign then March saw the acceleration of the Covid-19 crisis. A backstop was finally created on 18</span><sup>th</sup><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> March when the Federal Reserve announced they’d start buying corporate bonds and, due to the natural lags in bond pricing, the widest spreads were not seen in physical bonds until 23</span><sup>rd</sup><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> March (illustrated on the chart). The sell-off encompassed all sectors so there was nowhere for the Fund to hide; however, the worst hit areas were fastidiously avoided. This means that the drawdown has been of the mark-to-market variety, as opposed to a permanent destruction of value. The natural investment universe for the Fund now offers fantastic value and the yield alone should aid in the recovery of returns.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Carry Component</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br />
        We split the Fund into the Carry Component and three Alpha Sources for clarity in reporting, but it is worth emphasising we manage the Fund’s positioning and risk in its entirety. For the majority of the quarter, the Fund was run with a low duration of 0.5 years</span><sup><span>†</span></sup><span>, with the rates exposure emanating from US investments. European rates risk arising from investment grade credit was hedged out using German 5-year (BOBL) futures; this US preference proved to be the right geographic mix for the Fund.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The Carry Component represents three quarters of the Fund’s assets and thus was the area which generated the majority of the drawdown for the Fund. We avoided most of the sectors that were hit hardest by the crisis: the Fund has zero leisure exposure, no airlines and now no airports as a Heathrow bond matured during March. We do own a 0.5% position in an aircraft leasing company, <strong>Avolon</strong>. This sold off dramatically and we did try to sell the bonds but the bid evaporated. Avolon has plentiful liquidity to ride out the storm and strong asset backing so we are now retaining the holding.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Retail exposure is less than 1.5%, with <strong>Seven &amp; I Holdings</strong> (the Japanese owner of Seven Eleven) and <strong>CVS</strong> being the only two holdings. Within energy, the Fund has a small holding (under 0.2%) in a conventional <strong>Occidental</strong> bond having profitably sold a larger position in its floating rate notes; the company was junked in March and so now counts as part of Selection. The only other two energy names owned are <strong>BP</strong> and <strong>Shell</strong>.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>To give an example of how oversold the market became, at one stage a 2023 maturity <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> bond was in the low 80c area; it has now recovered to the low 90c and has further upside left to go. Although this is an extreme example, the majority of the Carry Component is trading below par and will naturally gain as the bonds approach maturity.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Alpha Sources</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span><br />
        Rates</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br />
        The Fund generated alpha from a Norwegian 5-year sovereign debt versus short German 5-year BOBL future position. Norway felt the sharp impact of the oil rout as well as the Covid-19 crisis and monetary policy was aggressively eased accordingly. The position was profitably exited. We made money out of a small long New Zealand 10-year bonds versus short Australian government bond futures cross market position; but lost a little more from being long New Zealand 15-year bonds against Australia later during the quarter.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>An inflation breakeven position was entered into in the US by buying Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and selling the Treasury bond future. The global policy response will be reflationary, but the entry into the position was at the incorrect time and was offside during the quarter.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Allocation</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br />
        At the beginnings of the Covid-19 crisis the Fund had a defensive Allocation alpha position being long risk the iTraxx Europe Credit Default Swap Index (this index is often referred to as “Main”) and short risk the same amount of the iTraxx Senior Financial CDS Index. The spread widened as the latter is higher beta and more systemic in nature, so we took profits. In crises, price dislocations often occur and then naturally mean revert when the market panic abates. The Fund made money twice out of being long risk CDX IG, the US investment grade CDS index, versus short risk Main. Towards the end of March, the position was entered into again and we anticipate generating alpha again from this.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span><br />
        Selection is naturally long credit risk; therefore, it is no surprise that this alpha source suffered mark-to-market losses during March. Two longer dated euro denominated holdings, <strong>Danaher</strong> and <strong>Eli Lilly</strong>, dragged on performance. Even holdings such as a May 2025 maturity (a tiny bit too long to qualify for Carry) <strong>Verizon</strong> floating rate note came under pressure. The Fund took advantage of the valuation opportunity in US financials to buy a small basket of investment grade-rated subordinated debt in quality names (<strong>AIG</strong>, <strong>Met Life</strong> and <strong>State Street</strong>). By the end of March they had added a few basis points of performance.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The Fund entered the crisis with a low high yield weighting and note that the maximum is 10%. In the sell-off we bought a couple of smaller sized positions in very high-quality names such as <strong>Iqvia</strong> (a health IT and clinical research company) and <strong>Netflix</strong>. The weighting at the end of March was 5% - note this includes 1% in a split rated subordinated <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> bond which we prudently classify as high yield.</span></p>

Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned 5.1%* in April. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index returned 3.1%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned 3.8% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was 5.5%.</strong></p>
        <p>Strength in sterling stemming from Theresa May’s move to call a snap election held back returns from UK large-caps (FTSE 100 Index -1.3%) and weighed on the capitalisation-weighted FTSE All-Share Index which returned -0.4% in the month. The environment at the small cap and micro cap end of the market was markedly different, with investors showing signs of risk appetite, perhaps buoyed by hopes of a smoother Brexit process if the Conservatives succeed in strengthening their mandate on 8 June. </p>
        <p>This environment of buoyant investor sentiment provided a strong backdrop to the IPO of K3 Capital Group (+18.4%), which the Fund participated in. K3 Capital Group is a company sales specialist working across the business transfer, business brokerage and corporate finance sectors. A disruptor in what can be a relatively inefficient market, it has built a powerful distribution network (both physical and electronic) which allows it to efficiently generate new leads (businesses for sale) and offer these to the widest network of potential buyers. With the IPO priced at a p/e of less than 10x and a prospective dividend yield of 8% it came as little surprise to see the shares perform well post-listing, following strong demand in the pre-market.</p>
        <p>The rally at the small cap end of the market also helped sustain share price momentum for Science Group (+22.4%), whose shares have been benefitting from upgrades to earnings estimates since releasing final results at the beginning of March. Its shares have also been pricing in the benefits to the company of weak sterling, and the company’s management team has been adding to holdings regularly over the last year. Medica Group (+18.4%) – featured in last month’s update – was another to drift higher in a benign environment despite a lack of significant newsflow. </p>
        <p>Among those holdings to release statements in April, IMImobile (+24.6%) was prominent. The cloud communications software and solutions provider issued a trading update which struck a positive tone, stating that profits for the year to end-March were on course to be slightly ahead of market expectations, and commenting that cash generation had been strong. The company had suffered a de-rating of its shares during the second half of 2016 due to some exposure to the Nigerian Naira, so this return to form was a welcome reminder that the long-term opportunity remains intact.</p>
        <p>Learning Technologies Group (+24.1%) was another strong contributor to the Fund in April, its shares rallying strongly on the back of in-line final results for its year ending December 2016. The shares also received a boost as the acquisition of AIM-listed learning management solutions provider NetDimensions completed. Learning Technologies can now provide a full service e-learning offering, including content, analytics, standard interoperability and now owns a system on which to host it.</p>
        <p>Although a trading statement from data science led media agency Jaywing (-8.0%) indicated that trading for the year ending 31 March was to be in line with expectations, its shares gave back some ground. This move should, however, be viewed in longer term context – as should the company’s underlying growth. The shares have generated a positive return year-to-date, reflecting progress in developing Economic Advantage intangible assets. Jaywing continues to leverage the intellectual property of its data scientists to create a sticky distribution network for its services, and it is well on its way to adding the third core Economic Advantage intangible asset, having grown recurring revenues to “almost 60%” from 50% back in 2015 (at over 70% we consider recurring revenue as an intangible asset candidate). Its trading statement revealed that, despite completing the acquisitions of Bloom Media &amp; Digital Massive within the period, the company has been able to reduce its net debt to £3.5m, below the £4.6m expected. </p>
        <p>Shares in AB Dynamics (-4.6%) slid due to concerns over the performance required in the second half of its fiscal year in order to meet forecasts. It released interim results which reported £11m of revenues, versus a full year target of £24.5m. Management remains confident on delivering the required second half growth, due to increasing demand for its track testing products and a strong forward order book. Growth in its core business may be supplemented by an exciting new product which enables global auto-manufacturers to speed up prototyping of new models. This product is in the very early stages of commercialisation, so we will be following with interest whether it can generate its first sales in the second half of the company’s fiscal year. </p>
        <p>Instem (-4.0%), the provider of software and services to the early development healthcare market, saw its shares mark time in May after lacklustre numbers reported last month. Part of the reason for a subdued investor reaction to Instem’s results was the lack of clarity over the accounting treatment of a new contract with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. In May, its auditors decided that Instem can book revenue and profit in the current year, which should help the company meet this year’s earnings forecasts.</p>
        <p>Shares in Curtis Banks (-3.7%), one of the UK’s leading SIPP providers with over 72,000 accounts under administration, drifted despite a relatively solid looking set of numbers at the end of March. The company’s suffered a bout of indigestion with regard to its largest acquisition to date, Suffolk Life (acquired in May 2016), which so far hasn’t quite delivered on potential, but signs of stabilisation are there and the long-term potential of the group remains attractive. </p>

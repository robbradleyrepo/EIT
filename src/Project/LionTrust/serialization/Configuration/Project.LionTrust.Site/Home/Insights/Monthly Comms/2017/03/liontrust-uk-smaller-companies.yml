        <strong>For investment professionals only</strong>
        <div><strong><br />
        The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned 4.5%* in December, compared with the 6.1% return from the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index.</strong>
        <div><br />
        December saw a selection of additions to the Fund and one sale. Covering the departure first, following last month&rsquo;s shock profit warning from IT managed services provider Redcentric and subsequent plunge in price, the decision was taken to expedite the sale of the position. Redcentric&rsquo;s management ownership had gone below the Fund&rsquo;s 3% minimum level in June and therefore the position was in the process of being sold irrespective of this negative development. With the share price recovering from the initial knee-jerk lower, the opportunity was taken to exit the remainder of the holding.</div>
        <div><br />
        Three new portfolio positions were initiated, all of which possess strong intellectual property, one of the three key Economic Advantage assets which form the heart of the investment process applied to this Fund. AB Dynamics is a leading designer, manufacturer and provider of advanced testing and measurement products for vehicle suspension, brakes and steering to the global automotive research and development sector; Cohort is the parent company of four innovative, agile and responsive businesses providing a wide range of services to the defence sector and related markets; and FW Thorpe designs and manufactures professional lighting equipment which is sold across the world.<br />
        <br />
        </div>
        <div>
        Craneware (+29.3%) enjoyed a strong bounce as the market looked through last month&rsquo;s heavy sell off &ndash; which had been due to concerns about how potential changes to Obamacare might impact it&rsquo;s business &ndash; and instead focussed on the strong sales pipeline and favourable market backdrop reported in their AGM statement.<br />
        <br />
        </div>
        <div>
        Law firm Gateley (+17%) rallied smartly after reporting solid trading, with additional benefits being felt from two recent acquisitions. Cash generation was also particularly solid; net debt fell to &pound;7.4m (down from &pound;12m) in spite of the acquisitions, and Gateley&rsquo;s outlook statement pointed to trading continuing in a similar vein in the second half. Employee-ownership culture below the main board also remains a clear positive for the group, with robust demand being seen for an all-staff share scheme.<br />
        <br />
        </div>
        <div>
        Ideagen (+21.5%) supplies Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) software to highly regulated industries. In December, it announced the addition of IPI Solutions to its stable. IPI&rsquo;s main product is &lsquo;Visual IP&rsquo;, a software platform which provides quality and compliance reporting, extending the reach of the Ideagen product suite into manufacturing industry processes. The acquisition announcement comes on the back of a positive trading update early in November, and led to further analyst earnings upgrades.<br />
        <br />
        </div>
        <div>
        Netcall (+14.2%), a provider of customer engagement software, released an AGM statement towards the end of November in which it referred to &ldquo;continued strong trading in the first few months of the financial year&rdquo;. Encouragingly, an increasing proportion of these sales are on a multi-year recurring basis, one of the three key intangible assets which the Economic Advantage investment process seeks to identify.<br />
        <br />

        In a month which saw broad-based gains for UK equities, the return pattern within the portfolio was skewed to the upside, with around two-thirds of holdings generating positive returns. Of the negative contributions listed below, none appeared to be triggered by corporate newsflow or fundamental concerns.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included:</strong><br />
        Craneware (+29.3%), RWS Holdings (+20.9%), Ideagen (+21.5%), Gateley Holdings (+17.0%) and Netcall (+14.2%).</p>
        <p ><strong>
        Negative contributors included:</strong><br />
        Accesso Technology (-6.3%), Globaldata (-4.4%), Imimobile (-1.9%), Gamma Communications (-1.5%) and Wilmington (1.1%).</p>

        <p>&bull; Past performance is not a guide to future performance. &bull; Do remember that the value of an investment and the income from it can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount originally invested.&nbsp; &bull; Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage Team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. &bull; The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and will be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses. </p>

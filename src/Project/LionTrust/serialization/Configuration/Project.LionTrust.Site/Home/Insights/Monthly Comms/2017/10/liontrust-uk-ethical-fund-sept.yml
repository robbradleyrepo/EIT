        <p><strong>The Fund enjoyed a strong quarter relative to the MSCI UK benchmark, registering a return of 3.87% against 1.82% from the index *.</strong></p>
        <p>This was driven by good returns across a number of our holdings. Sophos for example, which benefits from our Enhancing digital security theme, had a solid quarter as the strong growth in new business for its cyber security software became evident. </p>
        <p>Sophos sells to SME market worldwide: cyber-attacks there may not attract the kind of headlines that recent assaults on WPP and Reckitt Benckiser received but are just as significant for the businesses in question. </p>
        <p>Worldpay, the electronic payment company, received a bid approach from Vantiv and we took profits by reducing our position post-announcement. The merged company will have greater scale in this area of structural growth: we continue to see more cashless transactions as it is more convenient and also reduces fraud.</p>
        <p>Lightweight packaging company RPC also bounced back over the quarter, vindicating our analysis that countered stories the company had been growing too rapidly by acquisition. Elsewhere, another of our larger positions Kingspan delivered strong results as energy efficiency in buildings drives greater demand for its products.</p>
        <p>On the negative side, Porvair and Melrose gave up some of their strong performance. We are comfortable with the long-term prospects of Melrose but our analysis of Porvair identified a new product the company has developed for medical use. This had to be tested on animals to gain regulatory approval and since it is a non-negligible fraction of sales (circa 1%), we have sold our position in line with the animal testing criteria that apply to this Fund.</p>
        <p>Gym Group was a new addition to the portfolio over the quarter, with the company benefiting from our Enabling healthier lifestyles theme. The group has a network of low-cost, high-quality gyms and is expanding throughout the UK.</p>
        <p>Overall, the Fund&rsquo;s strong performance in Q3 is pleasing given the leadership of oil and mining companies through the quarter.</p>

        <p>&bull; Liontrust SF Absolute Growth Fund and Liontrust SF Global Growth Fund have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Liontrust SF Absolute Growth Fund invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and have a concentrated portfolio of securities. There is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund&rsquo;s share price.</p>

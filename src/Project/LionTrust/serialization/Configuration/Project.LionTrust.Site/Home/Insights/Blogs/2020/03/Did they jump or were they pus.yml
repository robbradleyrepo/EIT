      Value: The Federal Reserve announced a surprise 50 basis point rate cut in response to the economic risks of coronavirus. However, David Roberts thinks that monetary policy is a spent force and aggressive fiscal spending may be required to avoid a recession.

        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: black;">It is rare indeed for the Federal Reserve to change interest rate policy between meetings and unheard of to cut rates the day after the Dow Jones posted its biggest points rise in a decade. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Pressure from President Trump and concerns that equities had retraced all the way back to October levels seemed too much for Fed chair Jerome Powell to put up with. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Our view is that the impact of the Coronavirus could be a major economic shock. However, it is nigh on impossible to see how monetary policy can change the course of that impact; perhaps it could lessen it slightly, but change course, no chance.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">We need aggressive fiscal policy; we need to create demand now. If monetary responses reduce the propensity for political/fiscal action, as they have done since 2009, then we may find a recession looming. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">That is all in the future of course and for now, we need to ask:</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li><span style="color: black;">Is the situation already so bad that we should panic, is that what the Fed is telling us?</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: black;">Is this truly the first of a possibly co-ordinated series of moves that will at least dampen and at best avoid a recession?</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">While those are the big questions for most holders of risk assets, it is a little easier for investors in core bonds. Unless we see new, aggressive quantitative easing, we are likely to see the following: </span></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span style="color: black;">Curves steepen: if it works, the Fed cut will boost economic activity eventually, so long-dated bonds might be an accident waiting to happen, especially if inflation kicks in.</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: black;">Inflation-protected bonds (UK linkers, US TIPs) should have a day in the sun. The UK looks expensive, but in the US, 10-year inflation is being priced at just 1.4% and even before this cut, CPI was well above 2%. </span></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">So, for most assets it is difficult to say: is this a reason to panic, or a reason to believe the Fed has your back? For bond investors, the direction is uncertain but we believe short-dated and inflation-linked bonds should do better than the rest</span><span style="color: #1f497d;">. </span></p>

        <p style="color: #222222; background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.5pt;"><span>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

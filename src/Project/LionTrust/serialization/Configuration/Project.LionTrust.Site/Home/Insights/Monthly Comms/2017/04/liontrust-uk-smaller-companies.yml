        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned 2.1%* in March, compared with the 3.6% return from the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index.</strong></p>
        <p>With investors once again distracted by key central bank decisions as well as global political developments &ndash; with the UK&rsquo;s triggering of Article 50 and Dutch elections joining the Trump presidency at the forefront of thoughts &ndash; the small cap end of the market once again displayed evidence of its insulation from such macro considerations. While the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 posted 1.1 % and 1.4% total returns respectively in March, the FTSE Small-Cap Index registered a 2.9% gain which, stripping out investment trusts, rises to 3.6%. </p>
        <p>As one would expect, it was a heavy month for corporate newsflow, with many companies updating the market on the period to 31 December 2016. Preliminary results for the year to December were responsible for one of the portfolio&rsquo;s largest positive contributors, Bango (+43.9%). Its release confirmed an annual growth rate of 191% in the exit rate of End User Spend &ndash; a key metric which indicates the customer transaction volume put through its mobile billing platform. The market was also cheered by Bango&rsquo;s margin on that End User Spend coming in at 1.8%, slightly above analyst forecasts. </p>
        <p>Plexus Holdings (-17.6%) was another to report through to 31 December, but shares in the company fell significantly ahead of the interim results release. The announcement subsequently demonstrated ongoing pressure from the low oil price and reduced exploration activity, particularly in Plexus&rsquo; core North Sea customer base. Revenue fell 44% year on year, although net losses reduced after concerted efforts by the company to rein in its cost base. However, Plexus&rsquo; net cash position of over &pound;10m provided some level of comfort, and the company should be positioned well for the upturn when it comes, with high levels of inventory ready to be deployed into customers at short notice. </p>
        <p>The Fund&rsquo;s largest gainer in absolute terms was 1Spatial (+123%), the embattled provider of geospatial data software &amp; services. It provided an update on the strategic review and restructuring being conducted under its new Chairman, giving some clarity to the market. Perhaps a stronger driver of the share price move, however, was a spate of director share purchases on behalf of the Chairman and the interim CEO, which served to reassure investors with regard to the strength of the group&rsquo;s current balance sheet, as well as the future potential to exploit its intellectual property to commercial advantage.</p>
        <p>Another holding to experience a strong share price run in March was First Derivatives (+18.9%). It announced two important contract wins for its software business outside of the capital markets arena: the first with a Fortune 500 engineering solutions company, to underpin the customer&rsquo;s fault detection product range; the second a collaboration agreement with Airbus&rsquo; Defence and Space business, looking to facilitate rapid processing of large-scale geospatial data for a diverse range of end markets including energy, agriculture and civil engineering. The news was welcome evidence for investors that the predicted opportunities for First Derivatives&rsquo; Kx high-speed analytics platform in verticals outside of the company&rsquo;s core financial services expertise are now truly starting to come to fruition. </p>
        <p>Tracsis&rsquo; (+15.5%) share price dropped dramatically last month following an interim trading update in which it indicated that trading results for the year would be significantly second-half skewed. The share price fall came despite the house analyst holding full year numbers steady at the time. Somewhat counterintuitively, the shares then recovered in March when interim results were released, despite the same analyst opting to now cut full year results estimates by around 8%.</p>
        <p>Shares in illustrated book publisher Quarto Group (-14.6%) were weak in the run up to final results, which were released on the last day of the month alongside news of the resignation of the CFO. Although the core publishing businesses performed well over the year, posting 6% growth in revenue and a 17% rise in adjusted operating profit, group results were dragged down by increased losses at Books &amp; Gifts Direct (BGD), a direct sales business operating in Australia and New Zealand. The numbers validated the group&rsquo;s decision to dispose of BGD, selling the Australian portion of the business in a deal which was announced four days earlier and resulted in a further $14.2m impairment charge against profits.</p>
        <p>As flagged in its January trading update, Instem (-13.1%) has experienced a slowdown in its early-phase clinical market, offset to a degree by momentum around its technology and outsourced services offerings related to the US regulator&rsquo;s new Standard for Exchange of Non-clinical Data (SEND). Full year results released in March led to analyst revenue forecasts being held steady for FY2017 and even upped a little for FY2018, but news of additional investment in the business caused a sharp cut to forecast profitability, and sent the shares lower.</p>
        <p>Among other portfolio holdings to release preliminary results was Empresaria (-7.7%). The announcement triggered some profit taking following a very strong bull run since the start of the year. The company generated 20% growth in net fee income and 23% growth in adjusted operating profit, boosted by currency gains.</p>
        <p>Three new investments were added to the Fund during March: Caretech, James Cropper and Medica Group. </p>
        <p>Caretech is a provider of care homes to &ldquo;high acuity&rdquo; patients on behalf of local authority and health services commissioners throughout the UK. Such individuals &ndash; either adults suffering from learning disabilities and mental health problems, or children and young people with behavioural disorders or requiring foster care &ndash; typically stay in care homes for a much longer period of time than elderly patients (10 years on average), providing annuity-type revenue streams to the group. Caretech&rsquo;s physical distribution network represents a key Economic Advantage intangible asset. Caretech&rsquo;s portfolio of 450 care homes would be very difficult for a competitor to replicate from scratch, while the company has also built up a valuable network of vitally important relationships with local authorities in different regions.&nbsp; The Fund took the opportunity to acquire its initial position in the stock in March, when Caretech raised almost &pound;40m of fresh equity capital to fund the acquisition of further care homes and organic growth projects. </p>
        <p>James Cropper was established in 1845 and is currently stewarded by a member of the sixth generation of the Cropper family (as Chairman). It is a manufacturer of paper and technical fibre products. The paper division focuses on high-quality, coloured paper for niche end markets such as luxury packaging, which protects the company from commoditisation. However, a much larger contributor to the business&rsquo; margins is the technical fibre division, which makes bespoke, high-performance, non-woven materials, tailored to meet the specific and demanding performance requirements of end customers in the aerospace, industrials and automotive sectors. The group holds various patents in the application of these technical fibre products, as well as having plenty of technical know-how and trade secrets in its manufacturing processes. </p>
        <p>The Fund participated in the IPO of &ldquo;tele-radiology&rdquo; specialist Medica Group. The company is a provider of outsourced radiology reporting services to UK hospitals, both helping to alleviate pressure on hospital resources during routine hours and also dramatically improving efficiency during out-of-hours periods. Medica is already a scale player in the tele-radiology market, with an estimated 60% UK market share. However, the very low penetration of outsourced radiology work (currently only around 5%) offers plenty of scope for further rapid growth. The company enjoys its Economic Advantage via all three of the investment process&rsquo; key intangible assets. Its intellectual property advantage is found in a technology platform which has benefited from heavy investment over recent years. It has both a physical distribution network advantage in the form of scale, and also becomes significantly embedded within hospital workflows once the decision is taken to outsource. The majority of its contracts are also long term (the average length being 2-3 years), providing it with an attractive recurring income profile. The IPO was heavily oversubscribed and the shares performed very well on their 21 March debut, rising 37% by the end of the month.</p>

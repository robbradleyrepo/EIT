        <strong>For investment professionals only<br>
        </strong><br>
        <strong>The Fund returned 2.0%* in euro terms in February, compared with the 2.9% return from the MSCI Europe Index and the 1.3% return of the HFRX Equity Hedge EUR Index.&nbsp;</strong><br>
        <br>
        Net exposure at month end was c.59%. The strong performance from the Fund’s long book continued, boosted by favourable corporate financial releases. The short book made a small negative contribution.<br>
        <br>
        The rally seen in stock markets in recent months carried on in full force in February: the S&amp;P 500 Index rose 3.7% (US dollar terms), again reaching a new peak of 2369 on 27 February. In Europe, the mood was similarly upbeat with the MSCI Europe Index rising 2.9% in February (euro terms).<br>
        <br>
        After months of being dominated by political events and related news flow, global stock markets were influenced by more fundamental factors with a busy corporate results season and the release of macro data that included a strong UK Q4 GDP reading, higher-than-expected French and German PMI data and surprisingly strong Chinese trade data. This fundamental focus may be a short-lived trend as forthcoming elections in Germany, the Netherlands and France – as well as the resumption of Greek debt bailout talks – remain very much in investors’ thoughts.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Moves in US sovereign debt were quite muted during the month - the yield on US 10 year Treasury bills fell 5bps to 2.39%. In contrast, in Europe, moves were more pronounced with the yield on the German 10 year bund falling 24bps during the month to 0.21% and reversing nearly all of January’s gains. &nbsp;Similarly, UK 10 year gilt yields declined 27bps to 1.15%. Sterling weakened by 1.5% against the US dollar and was broadly unchanged versus the euro.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Sector performance was mostly positive across the MSCI Europe Index. The strongest performing sectors were healthcare, up 6.5%, consumer staples up 6.1% and information technology, up 5.8% in euro terms. The weakest performing sectors included financials (-0.3%), energy (-0.2%) and materials (+0.6%).<br>
        <br>
        In the Fund’s long book, the strongest performer was Oriflame, the Swedish consumer goods company. The shares rose 38% during the month following the publication of better-than-expected full year financial results, which showed evidence of strong growth in local currency sales, margin improvement, debt pay down and an extra dividend. Shares in AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group, a specialty metals and vacuum furnace producer, again performed strongly, rallying a further 18%. There was no significant corporate news flow and the shares outperformed the modest rise in the general metals, mining and materials sector. Centamin, the gold mining producer, also performed well during the month, rising 12%. The company’s full year results were well received and included solid growth in underlying profits, strong cash generation and a final dividend which was much higher than expected.<br>
        <br>
        There were no major negative contributors to the long book during the month. A modest negative contribution again came from some holdings in the energy sector, which experienced some further profit taking as the price of Brent saw another small decline during the month (-0.7%).<br>
        <br>
        One of the more significant positive contributions in the short book came from a UK infrastructure software company. The shares fell 36% over the month following a profit warning (the second in recent months). A trading update included the comment from the company that the performance of a key division would be “significantly lower than previously anticipated.” The company also announced that a strategic review would begin, while also cancelling the Capital Markets Day. The short book also benefited from weaker-than-expected results from a German wind turbine manufacturer. The shares fell as the company guided towards a weaker outlook for profits in 2018.<br>
        <br>
        A detractor from performance in the short book was a UK plastics and fibre producer. Its shares enjoyed a ‘relief rally’ as the publication of financial results did not include a (further) profit warning, suggesting that consensus expectations for 2017 would not change materially. A further detractor from performance in the short book was a discount retailer. The shares rallied on the news that it would no longer continue merger and acquisition talks with another retailer as terms of a potential deal could not be agreed. Shareholders had feared it may not have been an attractive deal and the shares rose following the announcement that talks had been terminated.&nbsp;<br>

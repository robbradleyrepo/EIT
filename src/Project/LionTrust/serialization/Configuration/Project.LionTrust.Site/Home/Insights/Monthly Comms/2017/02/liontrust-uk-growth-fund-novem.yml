        <b>For investment professionals only<br><br>
        The Liontrust UK Growth Fund returned -1.3%* in November compared with the -1.6% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</b><br><br>
        Donald Trump’s surprise US election victory sparked a rise in US equity markets and a sell-off in global fixed income as inflation and interest rate expectations firmed. For investors in UK-listed companies – particularly those with substantial overseas operations – another influential factor on returns was the High Court ruling that parliamentary approval will be required prior to invoking article 50. Sterling appreciated by 6% against the euro and 2% against the US dollar in November.<br><br>
        A combination of strengthening sterling and rising bond yields weighed on some of the more defensive international earners which can be found within the FTSE100, and the index returned -2.0% for the month. The Fund’s exposure to stocks fitting this profile includes: AstraZeneca (-9.6%), Diageo (-8.0%), Reckitt Benckiser (-7.5%), Compass Group (-7.4%), GlaxoSmithKline (-6.5%) and Unilever (-6.5%). Sectors of the FTSE All-Share Index to be affected by the ‘bond proxy’ sell off included utilities (-8.8%), telecoms (-9.2%), health care (-5.9%) and some areas of consumer goods (-6.2%). Overall the Fund is underweight to these four sectors, and we would argue that those holdings which are affected, have been caught in a fairly indiscriminate investor rotation, which fails to recognise their potential to generate excess returns over the long-term. AstraZeneca’s share price fall was accentuated by the release of Q3 results which were weaker than anticipated, showing the effects of generic competition to its Crestor treatment for high cholesterol. Shares in global catering contractor Compass Group lost some ground after the release of full year results; revenue and profit grew at a healthy rate of 11.5% and 11.7% respectively but there had been some hopes for margin expansion, which was not in evidence.<br><br>&nbsp;More cyclical stocks fared better as investors settled on a positive interpretation of Trump’s rhetoric. Within the Fund, Rotork (+15.0%), Aggreko (+2.0%), Wood Group (+7.0%) and Weir Group (+6.4%) were exposed to this trend, and all were also boosted to varying degrees by the oil price rise which accompanied a surprise OPEC agreement on production cuts. Other companies widely labelled as ‘winners’ from the election result included aerospace and defence stocks; the Fund’s holdings in BAE Systems (+10.7%) and Ultra Electronics (+8.9%) rose accordingly.<br><br>
        Actuator manufacturer Rotork (+15.0%) issued a trading update covering the four months from July through October. While it described trends in underlying trading as unchanged against a backdrop of market conditions which remain challenging, it has benefitted significantly from currency translation. Third quarter revenue increased 5% in constant currency terms but by more than 22% in reported terms. The company now estimates the currency tailwind it is receiving to be greater than previously expected and, as such, was able to guide towards the upper end of market expectations for full year revenue and profit.<br><br>
        Another strong performer was Tullett Prebon (+25.3%), as a Q3 trading statement revealed 15% growth in revenues to £216m. The majority of the increase can be accounted for by sterling weakness, as a large proportion of the company’s revenues are generated in US dollars – constant currency growth was 4%. Tullett Prebon stated that activity during the quarter was boosted by the volatility associated with political uncertainty and speculation around the potential for further interest rate increases. Later in the month it also received approval from the Financial Conduct Authority for its acquisition of ICAP’s voice broking business.<br>
        <br>
        Having rallied to an all-time high in October, shares in Halma (-10.0%) have since given back some ground, a trend which was not halted by the release of in-line interim results in November. The company, which manufactures a range of health and safety detection devices, generated £442m in interim revenues – a rise of 16%, around half of which is the effect of positive currency translation. Halma grew its revenues in constant currency organic terms across all its major operating regions and divisions with the exception of Process Safety, the smallest division, which suffered from soft demand in energy and resource markets. The company stated that order intake so far in the second half of its year is again ahead of revenue as well as last year’s comparable level, and it reiterated its confidence in full year guidance.<br><br><b>

        <strong>For investment professionals only</strong><br><br>&nbsp;The Fund returned 4.8%* in sterling terms in December, compared with the 6.9% return from the MSCI Europe ex-UK index.<br><br>
        The ‘Trump Rally’ maintained its momentum in December, sending a range of equity markets to fresh all-time highs. The MSCI Europe ex-UK Index experienced a broad-based rise, with all 10 industry groups registering gains. In a pattern which has become familiar in recent months, energy and financials were among the strongest performing sectors, up 11.5% and 8.6% respectively. These sector trends continue to be affected by the OPEC production cut announcement and the ongoing rise in bond yields. The biggest laggards during December’s rally included materials, rising 5.5% and consumer staples, up 5.7%.<br><br>
        The rise in European equities took the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index into positive territory for the fourth quarter and sealed an 18.6% total return in 2016. The strength in European equity markets was sufficient to push them into an uptrend as defined by the technical measures we employ, up from a neutral trend regime. Our analysis suggests that the establishment of an equity uptrend is usually characterised by further positive returns as well as subdued volatility. There is clearly scope for the heavy electoral timetable in the EU this year to disrupt this more benign picture. However, we prefer to make no predictions about the ramifications of what may or may not occur in Europe’s political scene.<br><br>
        As equity markets moved higher, US debt markets continued their sell-off, albeit more modestly. The yield on US 10 year Treasury bills rose 6bps to 2.44%, with the FOMC’s December announcement of a 25bps rise in US interest rates already largely discounted. However, the accompanying indication that three further rate hikes should be expected in 2017 (versus two at the earlier September meeting) – with the same number forecast for 2018 and 2019 – was perhaps slightly more hawkish than expected. In Europe however, the yield on the German 10 year bund reversed recent gains, falling by 7bps during the month.<br><br>
        The portfolio has reasonable allocations to both energy and financials – the strongest two sectors in December. While holdings within the energy sector feature prominently within the portfolio’s strongest contributors for the month, the stock picks in financials did not participate fully in the sector strength, which was led mainly by Italian banks. Italy rejected constitutional reform in its referendum, leading initially to heavy share price falls for Italian banks but they subsequently recovered strongly on bail-out hopes. The Fund has a small position in one Italian bank – Banco BPM, recently created through the merger of Banco Popolare and Banca Popolare di Milano – whose shares rose 18.8% in the month. By contrast, another of the Fund’s sector holdings, Deutsche Pfandbriefbank (-6.3%), was one of the worst monthly performers despite issuing no newsflow.<br><br>
        During the month, we added another banking stock to the Fund: Svenska Handelsbanken. Early in 2016 we commented that the opportunity to identify contrarian value in the European market was restricted to a few very specific pockets (of relatively wide valuation dispersion). The financials sector remains one of the sectors (alongside energy) to still offer this contrarian value.<br><br>
        We sold the position in Royal Wessanen as its cash flow scores have deteriorated.
        <br><br><p>Fund holdings to post market-beating returns on the back of the oil price’s 16% gain comprised: Fred Olsen Energy (+135%), Tethys Oil (+16.9%) and OMV (+10.6%). Shares in beleaguered oil &amp; gas rig operator Fred Olsen Energy were also boosted by the announcement that the company is nearing approval from its banks to waive debt covenants which it was on track to breach.<br><br></p><p>
        Shares in Swedish beauty product retailer Oriflame (+20.4%) recovered from last month’s fall. The sell-off had been sparked by Q3 results which, although strong, included management comments that Q4 trading had been more volatile. Following an excellent prior share price return in 2016, the November pullback looked to be the result of a bout of profit-taking which has now abated.</p><p><b>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bought – Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IHFL). </strong>We initiated a position in IHFL, the fourth largest housing finance company in India. Low risk mortgages account for 55% of the loan book with average loans in the range of US$35,000-40,000 and loan-to-value ratios of less than 70%. The balance sheet and asset quality are strong, with a non-performing loan ratio of less than 1%. IHFL is trading at a forward price/book of 2.5x with return on equity in excess of 25%, loan growth in excess of 20% and a dividend yield of 4.2%.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We funded the position in IHFL by reducing the Fund’s stake in HCL Technologies. There have been a number of bills introduced in the US Congress aimed at making it more difficult or costly for Indian IT companies to send their employees to the US on H1B visas. There is also a risk of a change in the visa allocation process from a lottery based system to one based on those paying the highest salaries. The US accounts for ~60% of revenues for most of the Indian IT companies and any significant change to the H1B visa process will be a negative. Given the increased risk, we decided to pare down our exposure.&nbsp;</p>

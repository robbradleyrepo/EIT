      Hint: LegacyPresentationBase_ShortDescription
      Value: In July’s Chart Of The Month we take a look at liquidity. It has quickly become a trending topic post the suspension of Neil Woodford’s Equity Income fund – but the detail is getting lost and we are rapidly approaching ‘liquidity good, illiquidity bad’ territory.

        <p class="mentions-texteditorcontent" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span>A few years ago, I ran a fund of hedge funds vehicle and explained my selection process as a combination of&nbsp;<span style="padding: 0cm; border: 1pt none windowtext;">performance</span>,&nbsp;<span style="padding: 0cm; border: 1pt none windowtext;">transparency</span>&nbsp;and pricing/liquidity. The latter was particularly important for hedge funds, many of which were only offering monthly dealing at that point, but what recent events have laid bare very clearly is that liquidity should be part of the selection criteria for any fund, whatever the structure or asset class.</span></p>
        <p class="mentions-texteditorcontent" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="mentions-texteditorcontent" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span>I favour funds that sit in the sweet spot of the above Venn diagram, ticking our box when it comes to performance and process but also recognising that transparency and liquidity can have a considerable impact on returns. Illiquidity is not automatically the villain - as long as investors can define and measure it properly and factor that into their risk/reward calculations.</span></p>
        <p class="mentions-texteditorcontent" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="mentions-texteditorcontent" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span>Liquidity can be as much of a trade off as any other risk when it comes to investing, and, ultimately, treating funds like ATMs that have to return your money within seconds will lead to diminishing returns.</span></p>

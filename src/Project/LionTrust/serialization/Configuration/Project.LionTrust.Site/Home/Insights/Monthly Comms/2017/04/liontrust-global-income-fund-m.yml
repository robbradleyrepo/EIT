        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund returned 1.1%* in sterling terms in March compared with the 1.6% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</strong></p>
        <p>With global equity markets having performed strongly in February, the environment was more subdued in March as the MSCI World posted a 0.7% sterling terms return. The S&amp;P 500 Index was broadly flat in US dollar terms and 0.4% lower in sterling terms over the month. Perhaps unsurprisingly, investors paused for breath following the 5.9% (US dollar terms) rally in the S&amp;P 500 since the start of the year and the 11% rally since the election of a new president on 8 November last year. Indeed, since its peak on 1 March this year, the index declined 1.4% as investors increasingly looked for evidence that the president can deliver on the election rhetoric for improved growth and infrastructure spend. The healthcare reform debacle (the failure by Trump to repeal Barack Obama’s healthcare law) did little to ease investors’ rising concerns. On the central bank front, the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates by 25 basis points as expected but the Federal Open Market Committee maintained its median estimate of three rate increases in total for 2017, slightly more dovish than some in the market anticipated. </p>
        <p>In Europe, the mood was much more upbeat. While the UK formally triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon and subsequently started the negotiation process for the UK‘s exit from the European Union, this had been well flagged and largely discounted by markets. Instead, investors in Europe focused on increasingly positive macro data. This included strong PMI data, a narrowing of the output gap, and the interpretation by some market participants of a less dovish tone in comments from ECB President Mario Draghi. </p>
        <p>In terms of the MSCI World index’s sector performance, information technology (+1.5%) and consumer discretionary (+1.5%) outperformed in March, while utilities (+0.7%) also made a positive contribution. Real estate (-1.4%) and financials (-0.9%) were the worst sector performers. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Man Wah Holdings delivered a strong return (+19.4%), with shares reacting positively to 2016 results and news of potential factory openings in the US. The Hong Kong furniture company said revenue rose 2.5% year-on-year in 2016 to HK$7.39 billion. Although the shares have recently recovered from concerns over the extent of Trump’s protectionism, the company still plans to increase its manufacturing capability in the US to offset risks of friction.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Pfandbriefbank (+16.4%) was another stand-out performer after it released 2016 results in which income was boosted by the release of write-downs. Consolidated pre-tax profit rose 54% year-on-year though net interest income rose slipped by 5%. The German real estate and public projects investor expects 2017 profit before tax to be in-line with 2016.</p>
        <p>On the downside, Bpost shares were hit (-6.3%) after the Belgian postal regulator rejected a proposed price increase in stamp tariff. The company said it was disappointed as the proposed price increase would reflect inflation and further expected falls in mail volume. </p>
        <p>British Gas owner Centrica (-4.4%) underperformed the utilities sector. While there was little corporate news from the company itself, it is one of the ‘Big Six’ UK energy suppliers coming under increased political pressure to reduce the premium of variable tariffs over fixed rates. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Man Wah Holdings (+19.4%), Deutsche Pfandbriefbank (+16.4%) and Endesa (+9.4%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>JB Hi-Fi (-9.2%), Bpost (-6.3%), and Centrica (-4.4%).</p>

        <p>• Past performance is not a guide to future performance. • Do remember that the value of an investment and the income from it can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Investment in Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates.&nbsp;• Some of the Funds managed by the Cashflow Solution Team invest in smaller companies. These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. • The European Growth Fund holds a concentrated portfolio which could mean that it will be volatile when compared to its benchmark. • The Global Income Fund's expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.</p>

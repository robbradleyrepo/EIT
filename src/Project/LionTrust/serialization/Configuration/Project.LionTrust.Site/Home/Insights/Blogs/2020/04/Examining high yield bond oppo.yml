        <p><span>High yield is an excellent long-term, strategic asset class, something we have written about </span><a href="https://www.liontrust.co.uk/what-we-think/blogs/10-things-everyone--should-know-about-high-yield-bonds"><span style="color: #00b050;">before</span></a><span>. </span></p>
        <p><span>In our experience, however, many investors look to time their allocation to high yield, waiting for an attractive entry point to make a tactical allocation. This begs the question of whether recent volatility has opened up such an opportunity.</span></p>
        <p><span>High yield bonds consistently display resilience and good risk-adjusted returns versus equities: we like to compare the drawdown experience versus equities, for example, with the chart below showing the experience of the last decade plus.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="-/media/729530DAB39E4487888C8C30E2818C02.ashx?h=335&amp;w=599" style="width:599px; height:335px;" alt="Global high yield vs equities over 14 years" class="custom-image-height-auto" /></span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span></p>
        <p><span><em>Source: Liontrust, FE Analytics as at 31.12.19. The Liontrust GF High Yield fund’s reference index is the IA Sterling High Yield sector; FTSE 100, Nikkei 225 and S&amp;P 500 are used as reference indices</em></span></p>
        <p><span>Indeed, while we are not calling the bottom in this current bout of volatility, the peak-to-trough fall in the S&amp;P 500 this year (19 February to 23 March) was around 33%, while the Global High Yield Index fell by about 21%. </span></p>
        <p><span>The impact of the Covid-19 crisis and oil price plunge on global high yield, when measured by spread (the additional yield earned in top of government bonds), has been a large spike to well over 1000 basis points before rallying to currently sit at around 780bps. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="-/media/49F1B4DF6AE7434A813C59707448D008.ashx?h=338&amp;w=600" style="width:600px; height:338px;" alt="Global high yield spread" class="custom-image-height-auto" /></p>
        <p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Previous crises have seen pronounced spikes in spreads and typically these have represented an excellent entry point for medium to long-term investors.</span></p>
        <p><span>We’ve run the numbers on several past crises to analyse the subsequent returns for investors entering the market at this point. Because there will be sceptics over the role energy sector bonds are playing in current valuations, we’ve chosen to apply this analysis to a sub-index of the market that excludes energy and the lowest-quality bonds in the high yield universe.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="-/media/1BF749AC4C0E438BB6ECDDF9E9786458.ashx?h=131&amp;w=599" style="width:599px; height:131px;" alt="High yield ex energy and CCC through 700bps" class="custom-image-height-auto" /></p>
        <p><span><em>Source: Bloomberg, Liontrust</em></span></p>
        <p><span>This illustrates investor returns following a spike in spreads above 700bps. There have been four previous instances in the last two decades: 2002, 2008, 2011 and 2016. We can see that only in the 2008 sell-off, when widening spreads served as a warning of the Global Financial Crisis, did investors experience a negative one-year return when using a 700bps spread as a market entry signal. Even then, over a three year horizon a positive return of 9% per annum was produced (which is better than the 7.5% average annual return of the global high yield market since 2006).</span></p>
        <p><span>It seems that, for the ex-CCC &amp; Energy sub-index, a 700bps spread (for HY) entry point as a rule-of-thumb is solidly backed up by the data. However, the market has tended to only briefly spike above this level. So unless investors responded very rapidly, they would not necessarily have captured the exact gains illustrated above.</span></p>
        <p><span>It’s been the same story this year. Spreads on the high yield sub-index did spike above 700bps last month, hitting a high of 875bps, but have now tightened to around 600bps. This may leave investors wondering if they should still invest, given that they may have missed the trough in valuations (or peak in spreads).</span></p>
        <p><span>In making this decision, it might be helpful to revisit our 2008 example. The market spiked considerably higher than a 700bps spread before rallying from its most distressed point. By mid-October 2009, spreads had fallen to 6% (today’s level). Though it might seem the opportunity had been lost, an investor buying on 15 October 2009 would have received a one year return of 18% (and 12% per annum over three years and 9% per annum over five years).</span></p>
        <p><span>The speed of market movements during the Covid-19 crisis has put even the Global Financial Crisis in the shade, with spreads coming in from 875bps to 600bps in a matter of weeks. </span><span>Markets are highly likely to remain volatile in the short-term and could conceivably spike above the 700bps level again. However, rather than waiting for another short, sharp spike through the 700bps threshold, we’d suggest that investors instead take confidence from historic returns analysis, which suggests that </span><span>today’s market levels still represent a very good entry point.</span></p>
        <p><span>When it comes to coronavirus and its economic impact, it’s important to recognise that we – along with other investors – have no expertise. The short-term direction of the market is therefore dangerous to call. But by comparing today’s valuations to past instances of heightened uncertainty, we can see that a longer-term investment opportunity may exist. High yield bond spreads sit well above levels that have previously heralded good investment returns.</span></p>
        <p><span>When looking to take advantage of such a compelling ‘top-down’ investment opportunity, we need to make sure that we select the correct individual bonds. To do this, we focus our ‘bottom-up’ bond selection on pertinent credit drivers, which we have labelled our credit PRISM. </span></p>
        <p><span>In judging whether a company’s bond is an attractive long-term investment, we analyse the following factors: </span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Protections - </span></strong><span>Operational analysis and contractual e.g. structure, covenants</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Risks - </span></strong><span>Credit, business and market </span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Interest cover - </span></strong><span>Leverage and other key ratios</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Sustainability - </span></strong><span>Cash flows and ESG factors</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Motivations -&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Management and shareholders</span></p>
        <p><span>With high yield bond spreads trading at elevated levels, a number of bonds are on distressed prices. It is possible for us to use this market disruption to seek out mispriced bonds.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>To illustrate, we have summarised our PRISM findings on four bonds held within the fund and trading on distressed prices but which we think are oversold:</span></p>

            <li><span>The autos sector is cyclical and extremely vulnerable during this lockdown. Its global footprint should at least be going through the worst parts of lockdown at different times. Looking at the Automotive Experience division of Johnson Controls during the financial crisis indicates the severity of the impact that the cycle can have. Sales fell by one third and EBITDA was wiped out. In 2010, this division returned to an EBITDA margin of 6%.</span></li>
            <li><span>Adient did not come into this period in the greatest of health as it has been plagued with operational issues for the last 18 months.

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span>In its most recent communication with investors, EnQuest announced efficiency efforts had reduced its cash flow breakeven (cash left over after all cash spending) on Brent crude to c.USS$33/barrel in 2020. With realisations in the first quarter of 2020, the forecast cash flow breakeven falls to c.US$25/barrel for the remainder of the year. 2021 cash flow breakeven is now forecast at c.US$27/barrel.</span></li>
            <li><span>Having had operational hiccups in recent years bringing large development assets into production, its capacity is operating well, particularly the crucial Kraken field offshore Shetland.</span></li>
            <li><span>EnQuest has repaid all scheduled bank debt amortisation for 2020. In addition, the bonds allow for interest payments to be paid in kind, arresting cash payments in the short term.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span></span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Risks</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Clearly the Brent oil price is the key risk.</span></li>
            <li><span>Bank and bond debt need to be repaid/refinanced by 2022/23.</span></li>
            <li><span>Substantial decommissioning liabilities means bond recovery in bankruptcy will likely be negligible.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span></span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Interest cover (&amp; other financial metrics)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Net debt/EBITDA is below 1.5x and there is substantial interest cover. However, the key stat is its cash flow breakeven. For every US$1 that realised prices fall below breakeven, the company burns cash. If we assume 160m barrels of production in 2020, then US$1 below US$25/barrel breakeven is US$160m cash burn. It has US$290m of liquidity. </span>
            </li>
            <li><span>Note that EnQuest had 20% of 2020 production hedged at around $65/barrel, which relates to Q1 hedging. It is largely unhedged henceforth.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span></span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Sustainability</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>EnQuest has a BBB rating from MSCI (which follows a scale similar to credit rating agencies), a high rating in a high yield market context. EnQuest scores well on corporate governance and safety, less so on biodiversity and carbon emissions.</span></li>

        <ul>
            <li><span>Stockmarket-listed with ~US$280m market cap and high inside ownership: the CEO owns 10%.</span></li>
            <li><span>EnQuest has been in debt reduction mode since the oil price stress in 2015. Management has been committed to this goal, including large contributions to equity capital raising. However, we suspect fresh equity is not the route out of current stress for this company.</span></li>

        <p style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.5pt; text-align: start;"><span style="color: #222222;">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The issue of units/shares in Liontrust Funds may be subject to an initial charge, which will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term. Investments should always be considered as long term. &bull; Any decision to invest should be always based on the final Prospectus and Key Investor Information Documents (KIIDs) and you should take independent legal advice if necessary.

        <p>&bull; Liontrust SF Absolute Growth Fund and Liontrust SF Global Growth Fund have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Liontrust SF Absolute Growth Fund invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and have a concentrated portfolio of securities. There is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund&rsquo;s share price.</p>

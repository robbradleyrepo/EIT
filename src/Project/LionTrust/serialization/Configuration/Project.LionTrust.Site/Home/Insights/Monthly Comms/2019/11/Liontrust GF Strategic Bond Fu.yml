        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>The Liontrust GF Strategic Bond Fund returned 0.7%* in US dollar terms in October. For comparison</span></strong><strong><span> </span></strong><strong><span>the average return from the EAA Fund Global Flexible Bond USD Hedged peer group was 0.4%. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Market backdrop</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>In October 2019 there were three important market drivers that all reached the end of their respective chapters. The Federal Reserve finished implementing its “insurance cuts” to rates and Draghi completed his 8-year tenure as president of the ECB; I expand upon these below as well as taking a more tongue-in-cheek look at the end of the latest part of the Brexit saga.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>As widely anticipated by economic forecasters and the bond markets, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points to a 1.50-1.75% range at the end of October. This is the third such reduction in rates, with the loosening in monetary policy referred to by the Fed as “insurance cuts”. Previous occasions where rate cuts were framed in this way occurred in the 1990s; both times also saw 75 basis points of cuts. So, is this the end of the rates cycle for the Fed?</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The answer to that question is, to paraphrase, “maybe” according to the Fed, whereas I really think it should be “yes” for the foreseeable future. The Fed has removed the line “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion” from its statement; this is widely interpreted as a strong hint that the Fed is done for now. Any further cuts would only be warranted if economic data deteriorates further and the Fed will monitor this to assess “... the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.” Furthermore, both Esther George and Eric Rosengren dissented again, voting against the cut.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The economic data really are not that bad: US third quarter real GDP figures released on the 30th October exhibited an expansion of 1.9%. This was driven by 2.9% growth in personal consumption; a negative arises from weak investment and capital expenditures are expected to fall further due to uncertainty created by the trade war.&nbsp; But provided the consumer remains robust the US economy will muddle through.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We are delighted that Mario Draghi’s reign has come to an end. Eurozone monetary policy has long since passed the “reversal rate,” the level at which further loosening becomes counterproductive. He hands over a restarted QE (Quantitative Easing) programme to the new European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde; the former French minister of the economy and finance, and more recently managing director of the International Monetary Fund. On the positive front Draghi also hands over an increased emphasis on the need for fiscal policy to work in conjunction with monetary policy as the former could have far greater efficacy in boosting growth. As much as Draghi did a good job of managing through the eurozone sovereign crisis, the perpetuation of extraordinary monetary policy has delayed long needed structural reforms; the epitome of this is the continued high debt levels in Italy that the proverbial “bond vigilantes” cannot sufficiently protest against due to the tsunami of QE.&nbsp; Productivity growth remains moribund as low rates distort executive incentive structures and keep zombie companies afloat. To be clear, Draghi is by no means the only culprit of this counterproductive addiction to QE, but he certainly has been one of the worst offenders.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Here in the UK the excitement was almost tangible as Season 3 of Brexit reached its dramatic climax. Who can forget the look on Arlene’s face when she realised that Boris’ deal has hung her out to dry, or the dramatic plot twist when Oliver had his amendment passed and then decided to back Boris’ deal even though it is worse than Theresa’s deal? We now must wait six weeks until we find out what happens with the cliff-hanger season finale, the general election. Boris’ party is riding high in the polls, but Theresa fell for that trap way back in Season 1 in 2017. Even if Boris’ Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes near the start of Season 4, we have so many exciting new developments to look forward to: will the European Research Group (a right wing of the Tories who are neither particularly European nor seem to ever have done any research) try to create a crashing out Brexit at the end of the truncated transition period? Will Jeremy come off the fence and stop “playing the long game?” And will Nicola build a wall on her southern border? With trading agreements likely to take at least 10 years to renegotiate one thing is for certain: you’ll have plenty more seasons of Brexit to look forward to.<br></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br></p>
        <p><strong><span>Rates<br><br></span></strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The Fund’s duration oscillated between 2.7 and 3.0 years during October. We were particularly active in Gilt futures, taking advantage of Brexit-related volatility to be contrarian and add or subtract 0.25 years whenever the market overshot. We are keeping sterling duration close to zero but using the noise around the political Brexit farce to target alpha for the Fund.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Incremental performance was also made from tactically taking advantage of the compression between US and Canadian 10 year bonds. Norwegian sovereign debt had rallied strongly against Germany, so we took half of the Fund’s profits; given the short-dated tenor of the bonds this resulted in a temporarily high cash position at month end.&nbsp; In early November a retracement has enabled us to reinvest into the Norwegian 2025s, deploying cash and taking the position relative to German 5-year BOBL futures back up to 0.5 years. Another strategic position implemented during October is buying Swiss 10-year debt relative to the German 10-year Bund future; the spread between the two has narrowed too far and the Swiss National Bank is yet to react to the latest round of easing by the ECB.</span><br></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>For most of this year we have been running with a curve steepening position in the Fund, preferring shorter dated 5- and 10-year maturity US Treasuries against being short 30-year US Treasuries using bond futures. The rationale behind this is that monetary easing will positively impact shorter-dated bonds which are more anchored to base rates, but longer-dated bonds will sell off as the Fed pump primes the economy. Clearly once the Fed stops easing this begins to reverse. We thought the Fed would opt for a hawkish easing at its meeting so put on a curve flattener ahead of this, buying 30-year futures and selling 5-year ones in a duration equivalent amount. This was tactically reducing an underweight, rather than going overweight, at the current differential of approximately 65 basis points between 5- and 30-year debt; if we were to see that differential increase to 80 basis points then a more strategic overweight of the long end could be warranted.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Allocation</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>The investment grade credit weighting in the Fund stands at 45%, split between 38% in conventional bonds and 7% in US floating rate notes (FRN). The Fund attracted good inflows during the month so holdings in various investment grade bonds and FRNs were topped up to maintain the overall allocation. The corporate bonds themselves are fairly defensive in nature, leaving us well positioned to buy risk on any market correction.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>We purchased some high yield risk in the mild turmoil earlier in the autumn; the asset class has rallied since and profits were taken in October in the CDX HY (a US credit default swap index) overlay. This leaves the Fund with 15% in high yield, consisting of 10% in physical bonds and a 5% iTraxx Xover overlay (the European credit default swap index). On weakness we would seek to buy more of our top stock pick selections to take the physical weighting up to 20%, then adjust any CDS index overlays accordingly.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Selection</span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br>The Fund banked its profits in the </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Rothesay Life</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> bonds that were issued in September. They were sold exactly 200 basis points tighter than their reoffer spread in a period of only 6 weeks. As Rothesay is a riskier name we prudently held a small position size but it still generated a handful of basis points for the Fund. Positions in two lower risk issuers’ bonds, </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Danaher</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> and </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Eli Lilly</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">, were established in October; both are US healthcare stalwarts and their bonds denominated in euros are incredibly cheap relative to those in their domestic US dollar market.</span><br></p>
        <p><span>Within the high yield universe, the Fund bought back into <strong>Softbank</strong> whose bonds had been oversold due to the well documented problems at one of their investments WeWork.&nbsp; </span></p>

        <p><strong><span>Key Risks&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span></p>

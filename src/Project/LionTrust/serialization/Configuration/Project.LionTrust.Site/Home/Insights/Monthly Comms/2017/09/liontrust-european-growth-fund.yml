        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund returned 1.2%* in sterling terms in August, compared with the 2.7% return from the MSCI Europe ex-UK index.</strong></p>
        <p>Geopolitical tension between the US and North Korea weighed on global stocks in August. North Korea’s missile testing sparked a war of words between the two countries’ volatile leaders. Trump warned that North Korea would be met with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” while North Korea responded by suggesting Kim Jong Un was considering a strike on US territory of Guam. The escalation in hostility between the two leaders hurt global equities and propped up safe havens such as gold, which rose 4.1% in August. </p>
        <p>However, the MSCI Europe ex UK Index gained in sterling terms due to the depreciation of the pound against the euro. When measured in local currency terms, the MSCI Europe ex UK Index fell 0.4%. The euro continued strengthening in August, touching its highest level against the pound since late 2009 and its highest level against the dollar since January 2015. Within the minutes of the ECB’s July meeting, the Governing Council voiced concern that the strength of the currency could damage the euro area’s economic recovery. </p>
        <p>All of the sectors in the MSCI Europe ex UK ended in positive territory. Utilities outperformed returning 8.7%, followed by real estate (+5.3%) and health care (+3.4%). The biggest laggards in August were financials (+0.2%), telecoms (+1.0%) and consumer staples (+1.7%).</p>
        <p>Among the Fund’s individual stock movers, <strong>Technogym </strong>(+20.8%) was the biggest contributor. The gym equipment and service provider’s interim profit more than doubled on the back of strong sales and the reduced impact of one off costs. EBITDA rose 20% year-on-year aided by the launch of new products. Technogym also stated that it became the official fitness equipment provider to the US Tennis Association.</p>
        <p><strong>Straumann Holding </strong>(+15.6%) was another portfolio stock to report upbeat interim results. The dental company’s revenue for the first half of 2017 climbed 18% compared to the same period last year. In addition to the results, Straumann announced that it is entering into the field of orthodontic dentistry with the acquisition of ClearCorrect for US$150m and increasing stakes in Geniova Technologies and Dental Wings.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Fund’s lagged performance versus the MSCI Europe ex UK Index was largely due to its resource holdings, which failed to join in the wider sector gains. Oil producer <strong>Fred Olsen Energy’s </strong>(-17.5%) second quarter loss was above analysts’ estimates, though its revenue and EBITDA both beat forecasts. <strong>Lenzing Group </strong>(-9.7%) saw its share price decrease despite strong half-year numbers. The Austrian textile fibres producer registered record revenue and EBITDA for the first half of 2017. Nordic property developer <strong>JM AB </strong>(-6.5%) shares were hit after investor OBOS sold its entire 5.2% stake.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Technogym (+20.8%), Straumann Holding (+15.6%) and Energias de Portugal (+10.6%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Fred Olsen Energy (-17.5%), Lenzing (-9.7%) and JM (-6.5%).</p>

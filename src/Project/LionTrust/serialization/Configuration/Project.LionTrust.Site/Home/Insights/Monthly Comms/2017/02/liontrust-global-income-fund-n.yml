        <b>For investment professionals only<br><br>
        The Fund returned -3.6%* in sterling terms in November compared with the -2.3% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</b><br><br>
        In a reversal of last month’s trend, sterling strength contributed to weak returns to UK investors from global equity markets. The MSCI World returned 2.6% in local currency terms, but -0.9% in sterling terms.<br><br>
        Contrary to expectations that a Trump win would be a negative outcome for markets, US equities recovered strongly from a post-election wobble, rallying to new highs. The S&amp;P 500 Index reached a new all-time high of 2213 on 25 November and ended the month 3.6% higher (US dollar terms). Debt markets continued their aggressive sell-off; the yield on US 10 year Treasury bills rose 56bps to 2.38%, as the probability of a US rate rise at the FOMC’s December meeting reached 100% according to Bloomberg’s analysis of implied probability in futures markets. In Europe, the yield on the German 10 year bund rose a further 11bps while UK gilt yields rose 17bps.<br><br>
        The MSCI sector return for the month tells a tale of investor rotation which reflects these wider asset class patterns: cyclicals were bid higher, while ‘bond proxy’ stocks de-rated. Financials was the strongest performing sector in sterling terms, rising 5.2%, taking some relative strength from the rally in bond yields. Energy and industrials also rose, by 2.8% and 1.3% respectively, while utilities (-8.5%), consumer staples (-7.3%), and real estate (-5.5%) were the weakest areas.<br><br>
        The impact of rising yield curves on traditionally high dividend yield sectors is likely to have been a key factor in the differential between the MSCI World’s -0.9% return and the -2.3% average in the IA Global Equity Income sector. The Fund has three positions in utilities and four telecoms holdings, giving it overweight exposure to the sell-off and yield expansion in these areas, but offsetting this was the Fund’s underweight positions in healthcare and consumer staples – both of which were caught up in the weakness.<br><br>
        The Fund is also significantly underweight the US: the result of a bottom-up stock selection process which currently fails to find much value in a US stock market trading on a cyclically adjusted p/e ratio of 28x. The few US-listed stocks which are held in the portfolio performed better than the market average in November. Foremost among them was Seagate Technology (+14.2%), whose shares rallied throughout the month having released Q1 results towards the end of October. Although revenue fell 4% to $2.72bn, the company implemented a proportionately larger reduction in operating expenses, leading to a 2.5x increase in operating income to $221m. Seagate Technology displayed its cash-generative credentials with a $592m operating cash flow, allowing it to fund $101m in share buybacks and announce a $0.63 dividend per share.<br><br>
        Ensign Energy Services (+10.6%) is a Canadian provider of oilfield services. Q3 results to 30 September showed large declines in revenue and EBITDA and a widening loss, the result of depressed oil and gas prices continuing to weigh on demand for the company’s services. But energy prices have picked up in October and November as OPEC moved towards agreement on an output cut, and Ensign’s shares have rallied accordingly.<br><br>
        The 24.7% share price fall in Medical Facilities in November looks to be the combination of weak sentiment towards health care sector stocks (and other defensives) and profit-taking following the release of Q3 results which were no better than in-line. Having rallied strongly over the summer, the shares may have needed stronger numbers in order to support upgrades to expectations. Following the correction, they are now back at their levels of six months ago.<br><br>
        Ashmore Group (-19.2%), as an asset manager specialising in emerging markets, is seen as an obvious victim of rising US rate expectations, which typically tend to draw capital away from emerging market assets.<br><br>
        Belgian postal operator bpost (-17.3%) disappointed with Q3 results before upping its takeover offer for Dutch rival on 30 November in a final effort to secure a deal. Although bpost reiterated full year guidance of achieving at least the same EBITDA as 2015, Q3 2016 was a tough period for the company, with revenues sliding 2.3% and EBITDA 3.4% behind last year’s level.<br><br><b>
        Positive contributors to performance included:</b><br>
        Seagate Technology (+14.4%), Genworth MI Canada (+11.3%) and Ensign Energy Services (+11.1%).<br><br><b>
        Negative contributors to performance included:</b><br>
        Medical Facilities (-24.7%), Ashmore Group (-19.2%) and bpost (-17.3%).<br><br>

        <p><strong>The Fund returned 0.6%* in sterling terms in October compared with the 2.3% average return from funds in the IA Global Equity Income sector.</strong></p>
        <p>The MSCI World Index rose 2.9% in October. The Fund lagged the return of the index as US equities, an area where we are underweight, continued their bull run with the S&amp;P 500 reaching yet another new record high. The US market was buoyed by upbeat earnings reports from high profile companies, particularly in the tech sector. Additionally, the absence of Japanese stocks held back Fund performance as equities in the region rallied in the run up to and following Shinzo Abe&rsquo;s election victory. </p>
        <p>Another macro highlight during the month was the European Central Bank revealing its strategy on the winding down of its quantitative easing programme. The bank extended QE to September 2018, with monthly asset purchases planned to fall from &euro;60bn to &euro;30bn in January 2018. However, the ECB&rsquo;s governing council stated that it stood ready to increase QE once again if the economic outlook becomes less favourable. President Mario Draghi specified in his press conference that the move by the ECB was a &ldquo;downsizing&rdquo; rather than a tapering, which he said was not discussed by the governing council at the meeting. The ECB also maintained that interest rates are expected to remain at present levels well past the end of the asset purchase programme. The euro declined 1.2% in trade weighted terms and bond yields in the UK and Europe fell after the Bank&rsquo;s announcement while European stocks gained. </p>
        <p>In the commodities space, Brent oil rose above US$61 a barrel for the first time since July 2015, which supported our energy holdings <strong>Fred Olsen Energy </strong>(+72.3%) and <strong>Total </strong>(+4.9%). The MSCI World Index&rsquo;s energy sector rose 1.3% in sterling terms, but was outshone by IT (+8.1%), materials (+4.0%) and utilities (+3.7%). Telecoms (-2.6%) and health care (-0.4%) were the only negative sectors. </p>
        <p><strong>Ashmore Group </strong>(+13.5%) was another strong performer. The emerging markets investment manager saw an 11% annual jump in assets under management for the quarter ending 30 September 2017, helped by a strong broad-based rally in emerging markets and an appreciation in emerging market currencies versus the US dollar. Data storage company <strong>Seagate Technology </strong>(+12.4%) also reported upbeat quarterly numbers with earnings per share coming in at 96 cents, beating consensus expectations for 86 cents. Additionally, the company&rsquo;s board approved a 63 cent quarterly dividend. </p>
        <p><strong>Big 5 Sporting Goods </strong>(-16.2%) was a notable detractor from performance in October. The US sporting goods retailer reported a 3% year-on-year decline in net sales during the third quarter of 2017, while same store sales decreased 2.9% compared to a 6.8% increase in the same period last year. Satellite operator <strong>Eutelsat Communications</strong> (-14.5%) saw revenue in the first quarter of its financial year to end September decline by 9.3% annually on a reported basis and 6.7% on a like-for-like basis. The company added that because of a delay in a lease payment on the Al Yah 3 satellite it lowered its full-year revenue guidance from &ldquo;broadly stable&rdquo; to between -1% and -2%.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>There were a few changes to the Fund&rsquo;s holdings in October. Following the release of full-year results in August and a strong run in its share price since purchase in June 2017, we sold McMillan Shakespeare as it no longer scores in the top quintile of our cash flow screen. We exited the position after the receipt of a final dividend in September. </p>
        <p>We also implemented some late additions from our annual restructuring. Positions were opened in Barratt Developments (UK), Hopewell Holdings (Hong Kong), Kimberly Clark (US) and Target (US).<sub></sub></p>

        <strong>For investment professionals only</strong><br>

        The Fund returned 2.7%* in euro terms in October, compared with the -0.8% return from the MSCI Europe index and the -1.0% return of the HFRX Equity Hedge EUR Index. Net exposure at month end was c.40%.<br>
        <br>
        The long and short books both performed well during the month, contributing 0.9% and 2.2% respectively. The long book benefitted from exposure to commodities – including gold – other materials and energy, as well as continuing strong momentum from some stocks whose quarterly results in prior months had shown evidence of strong structural growth. The short book benefitted from poor company news flow, including profit warnings and weak earnings results.<br>
        <br>
        It was a relatively subdued month for the MSCI Europe Index, although by month end it almost recovered from a weak first half. &nbsp;The financials sector was the strongest performing sector in the European market, up 6.0% in euro terms. This was followed by energy, rising 3.0%, and materials up 1.8%. The weakest sectors during the month again included real estate (-6.9%), perhaps reflecting the sector’s bond proxy characteristics, followed by information technology (-6.4%) and healthcare (-5.8%).&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Action in debt markets was more marked, as global bonds suffered a sharp sell-off driven by an upward shift in the benchmark yield curve. In the US, yields on 10 year Treasury bills rose 13bps. Contributory factors include the US rate rise which is expected at the FOMC’s December meeting, and the ongoing recovery and stabilisation of the oil price. In Europe, despite further speculation that the ECB will extend its asset-purchase programme, the yield on the German 10 year bund rose 28bps. In the UK, better than expected Q3 GDP was also a factor in gilt yields rising 50bps. But sterling continued its weak trend, falling 5.6% and 3.4% versus the US$ and euro respectively as worries of a “hard Brexit” mounted, taking the total depreciation since June’s Brexit vote to 18% and 15% respectively.<br>
        <br>
        In the Fund’s long book, the strongest performer was Evraz, the Russian steel manufacturer and mining company. The shares rose 23% in euro terms in anticipation of a Q3 production report and Investor Day. In particular, the company is benefitting from the rise in the coking coal price and Chinese output curbs. The Investor Day focused on various commercial and cost savings initiatives which should have a positive effect on EBITDA and debt reduction. Burford Capital, the UK-based litigation financing company, also performed strongly with the shares rising 12% during the month. There was no significant corporate news flow during the month, although a major shareholder did increase its stake further. Despite a rather mixed Q3 production report, Rio Tinto was another area of strength in the long book, the shares rallying strongly as investors appeared to take a more optimistic view on mining sector prospects for the coming years.<br>
        <br>
        German software infrastructure company Software AG detracted from long book performance. The company pre-released a disappointing Q3 earnings result which was below analysts’ expectations due in part to lower revenues from its Licenses business segment.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        In the short book, one of the more significant positive contributions came from a UK-based support services company. A trading update for the first four months of the year revealed that it had experienced a number of setbacks in the Assurance division, including a number of large contract cancellations and deferrals. On this basis, management commented that the rate of growth in profitability would now be more biased towards the second half the year than initially expected and that underlying profits for the full year would be below market expectations. Analysts subsequently lowered full year earnings forecasts for the company. The shares almost halved during October. The short book also benefitted from a profit warning from a Swedish-based Telecom equipment manufacturer. The shares fell nearly 30% during the month as the company pre-announced Q3 earnings that included a larger than expected revenue decline and a lower gross margin – which led analysts to implement significant reductions to full year profit forecasts. The company commented that network volumes and broadband sales were lower with Brazil, Russia and the Middle East were the weakest markets.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        There were no significant detractors from performance in the short book during the month.&nbsp;<br>

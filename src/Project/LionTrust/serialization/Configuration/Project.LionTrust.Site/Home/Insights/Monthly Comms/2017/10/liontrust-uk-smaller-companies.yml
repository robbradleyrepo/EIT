        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned 0.7%* in September, compared with the 1.1% return from the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index.</strong></p>
        <p>Although September saw a large volume of newsflow relating to Fund holdings, it was very much ‘business as usual’ for us, with the overall tenor of the releases being upbeat and none requiring us to revisit out assessment of companies’ Economic Advantage attractions. Share price returns showed the monthly variation one would expect in a period when a number of interim updates were released as investors reacted to marginal beats or misses relative to consensus. Cutting through these short-term share price moves we can clearly see evidence of good progress in the businesses the Fund owns.</p>
        <p>For example, of the two below-listed negative contributors to release results in September, neither showed any evidence of a deterioration in trading or negative outlook. Teleradiology specialist <strong>Medica</strong> (-8.9%) saw 17% growth in revenues to £15.7m in the six months to 30 June. Since the end of the period, it has signed up a further 24 radiologists taking its contracted total to 291. The company states that it is on track to meet full year expectations as it move into the traditionally higher volume second half of the year.</p>
        <p>Veterinary medicine group <strong>Animalcare</strong> (-7.5%) also grew revenues, up 7.9% to £15.9m in the 12 months to 30 June while underlying operating profit improved to £3.2m. Events since 30 June have however diluted the significance of these results given the transformative nature of Animalcare’s reverse takeover of Ecuphar NV for a £134m consideration: the combined entity has an 18%/92% pro-forma revenue split in favour of Ecuphar over the six months to 30 June. Animalcare will now have operations in seven countries in Western Europe and will look to exploit cross selling opportunities across their complementary customer bases and distribution channels. The company’s new Chairman commented that current trading in both businesses gives the Board confidence in “earnings accretion in 2018 and beyond”. The report further details that the integration is going well, with opportunities identified to combine activities such as their supply chains.</p>
        <p>The Fund’s largest monthly gainer was <strong>Accesso Technology</strong> (+18.4%), which issued interim results showing 17% growth in revenue to US$46.6m with adjusted operating profit rising 30% to US$6.5m. The company provides ticketing, guest management and e-commerce solutions to the leisure and entertainment market. Its key product is <em>accesso Passport </em>which is being rolled out across Merlin Entertainment’s portfolio, recently going live at Alton Towers. Recent contract wins include the NFL Experience in Times Square, The CNN Studio in Atlanta and Village Roadshow Theme Parks, Australia’s largest theme park operator. Despite adverse weather conditions contributing to lower-than-expected theme park attendance during the first six months of 2017, the company was able to reiterate its full year outlook. Typically, 60% of revenues are generated in the second half of its fiscal year.</p>
        <p><strong>Learning Technologies</strong> (+15.2%) increased its interim revenue by 68% to £21.5m. The growth was split roughly 50:50 between organic expansion and acquisitions after the company completed the purchase of NetDimensions. Learning Technologies is an e-learning specialist targeting expansion to £100m in annual revenues in the medium term, and describes NetDimensions as the “final key technical capability” that will allow it to offer corporate and public sector clients a fully comprehensive service. The company also commented that the start to the second half of 2017 had seen “trading ahead of management’s expectations and [an] order book significantly ahead of the prior year on a like-for-like basis”.</p>
        <p><strong>Judges Scientific</strong> (+11.5%) reported a 20% increase in interim revenues to £32.7m as three of its scientific instrumentation businesses continued to recover from the weak demand which held back growth in the first half of 2016 and resulted in two profit warnings. Organic order intake was up 28% year-on-year in the first half of 2016 with the organic order book now at 16.5 weeks. The strength of its order book underpins management’s confidence in delivering a full year performance in line with market expectations.</p>
        <p>Stepping away from interim results season, <strong>StatPro</strong> (+12.8%) was another prominent positive contributor after securing a two-year contract extension with a “large European asset manager” for its Delta service worth £1.5m. Having only completed the acquisition of UBS Delta in May of this year, the extension is an encouraging sign of the ongoing appeal of the product now it has come under the StatPro banner.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p>Accesso Technology (+18.4%), Learning Technologies (+15.2%), Statpro Group (+12.8%), Judges Scientific (+11.5%) and Robert Walters (+9.8%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Ideagen (-11.0%), Charles Stanley (-10.2%), Medica Group (-8.9%), System1 Group (-8.3%) and Animalcare Group (-7.5%).</p>

        <p> • Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</p>

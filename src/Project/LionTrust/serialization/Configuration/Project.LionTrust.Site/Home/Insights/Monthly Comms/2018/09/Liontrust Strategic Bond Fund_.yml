        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>August had three main themes in financial markets: President Trump’s ongoing trade wars, a growing emerging markets’ crisis in Turkey and Argentina, and the continued political tensions ahead of Italy’s budget setting. All of these factors conspired to create volatility that the Fund was able to exploit. As market participants return to work after the European summer holidays and US Labor Day we anticipate a meaningful increase in focus on the macroeconomic tensions and a deluge of investment grade credit supply. Ahead of these we have prudently decreased credit risk in the Fund, trimming some investment grade risk and taking the net high yield exposure down to 10%. This move is tactical in nature and we would expect to be contrarian and buy credit on any weakness, albeit keeping overall exposure in a conservative range due to the late cycle period we find ourselves in. Similarly, the duration of the Fund sits at 3 years* and, should rates markets rally, we would reduce this position to reflect economic data showing strong growth figures and increasing inflation.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Rates<br><br></span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The Fund’s duration was marginally lengthened by about one quarter of a year in August. The Fund’s adjusted underlying duration of 3.1 years* (4.1 years unadjusted) is still significantly lower than our 4.5 years midpoint or the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index duration of 7.0 years.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Most of the relative value positions in the Fund were contributors to positive performance in August. The spread between US Treasury yields and UK Gilts reduced and UK duration was tactically taken to a small positive number. Similarly, the differential between US and Canadian yields that had started to compress in July continued its trajectory which generated good alpha for the Fund.&nbsp; One of the strongest high quality government bond markets in August was Australia; just after month end at the 4 September meeting Philip Lowe, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, announced that rates were remaining at 1.50%, vindicating the market’s dovishness.&nbsp; A large part of the upside from this position has now materialised, but Australia is highly exposed to any increase in trade tensions and a steep yield curve offers strong roll down.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>The Fund established a new position in US 5-year inflation breakevens during the month; US 5-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) were purchased and the equivalent duration contribution removed from conventional US Treasuries.&nbsp; The inflation breakeven, the inflation rate at which you are equally rewarded for holding TIPS versus conventional debt, had fallen from 2.10% in early July to 1.95% during August.&nbsp; The majority of this reduction in the TIPS market’s inflation expectations was due to the prior strength in the dollar but neglected to account for the fact that dollar strength has stemmed from rampant US growth and headline CPI which is running at 2.9%.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Allocation<br><br></span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Credit spreads performed strongly in July and remained resilient in August.&nbsp; We took the opportunity to reduce some of the investment grade credit risk exposure in the Fund. The weighting is now 29% in conventional bonds and 5% in floating rate notes.&nbsp; With burgeoning problems in emerging markets we sold bonds issued from three companies where they could be hit by country specific issues. On the investment grade side, BNP and ING’s bonds were disposed of due to them having Turkish operations; their exposure is not big enough to existentially threaten the banks but it was prudent to lock in profits whilst they were still there.&nbsp; Within the high yield universe Codere, a Spanish company, has a large exposure to the Argentine gaming industry; the Fund prudently and profitably sold its bonds which are now over 5% lower than the exit price.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Some of the better-quality high yield bonds have performed very strongly over the last few months so positions in Belden, Gestamp and SiriusXM were sold on valuation grounds.&nbsp; We still favour all of these companies and would gladly buy back into their bonds should they retrace to more attractive levels.&nbsp; The Fund’s short risk exposure to the CDX HY index, a credit default swap index proxy for high yield risk, was increased thereby reducing overall high yield beta exposure.&nbsp; At the end of August the gross high yield weighting in the Fund was 19% coupled with the CDX HY hedge of -10%, giving a net exposure of 9%.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><strong><span>Selection<br><br></span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>In addition to the aforementioned credit sales, which were primarily instigated for asset allocation reasons, we undertook a few completely idiosyncratic credit trades in August.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Bayer, the German pharmaceutical and life sciences company, raised a large quantity of debt earlier this year. We made a quick, profitable turn on longer-dated euro debt which was issued much more cheaply than similar maturities in US dollars.&nbsp; We retained exposure to some of the low beta shorter-dated floating rate notes. Then the Monsanto lawsuit news hit. The bonds we owned fell 0.5%, but still remained above what we paid for them! This was a simple decision to sell – once a company attracts the attention of the US courts, bond holders need to be wary. Even if Monsanto is the proverbial storm in a tea cup there are myriad other investments more worthy of our clients’ hard earned cash.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>RBS has spent the last decade trying to simplify itself.&nbsp; One of the legacy structures remaining is RBS NV, which arose due to the ill-fated acquisition of ABN Amro.&nbsp; RBS NV will continue to operate so that RBS can settle various euro denominated transactions after Brexit.&nbsp; However, there is excess capital trapped at the entity and once RBS has disposed of its Saudi operation, Alawwal Bank, we expect RBS to upstream this capital for the benefit of shareholders.&nbsp; One of the side effects of this is that RBS NV bond capital instruments may well be subject to a liability management exercise offering bondholders some price appreciation. In the meantime the lower tier II bonds the Fund purchased have a very healthy 5% running yield.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span>Aroundtown is a German real estate business which has grown substantially in recent years. The market environment has been beneficial for them, with the availability of cheap debt coupled with rising property prices. Aroundtown has grown in a financially prudent manner, consistently raising both debt and equity to fuel growth. The Fund did hold the euro denominated bonds, which performed well during a period when similar types of bonds lagged. In August this was switched into a holding in a very similar Aroundtown US dollar denominated bond. In doing so, the Fund gained close to 1% extra spread. Our clients also now own a bond with a substantially lower price, which we believe protects to a degree from (unexpected) downside.</span></p>

Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Global Fixed Income team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The value of fixed income securities will fall if the issuer is unable to repay its debt or has its credit rating reduced. Generally, the higher the perceived credit risk of the issuer, the higher the rate of interest. Bond markets may be subject to reduced liquidity. The Funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</span><br></p><p style="text-align: left;"><b>Disclaimer<br></b>

            <li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="A2"><strong>Bought</strong> <strong>&ndash; </strong>Weichai Power.<strong> </strong>We expect the company, which is China&rsquo;s top diesel engine maker, to benefit from increased market share to the truck market and an environmental push to improve diesel quality engines by meeting NS6 emissions standards. This switch to more efficient engines may be accelerated by a rise in diesel prices. Weichai Power has a 17.5% return on equity and 4.7% dividend yield. </span></li>

        <p><strong><span>Key Risks </span></strong></p>
        <p><span>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. Investment in Funds managed by the Asia team involves foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. The Fund&rsquo;s expenses are charged to capital. This has the effect of increasing dividends while constraining capital appreciation.&nbsp; </span></p>

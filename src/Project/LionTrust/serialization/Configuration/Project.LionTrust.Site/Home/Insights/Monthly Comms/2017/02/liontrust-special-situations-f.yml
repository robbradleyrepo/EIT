        <b>For investment professionals only<br><br>
        The Liontrust Special Situations Fund returned -0.9%* in November, compared with the -1.6% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</b><br><br>
        The US election result dominated markets, as investors endeavoured to price in the impact of a Trump administration. An initial adverse reaction – involving a typical ‘risk-off’ rotation out of equities and into safe havens such as government bonds and gold – swiftly gave way to a more positive interpretation of Trump’s rhetoric. Consensus seems to have formed around a Trumpflation trade, in which his protectionist, fiscally stimulatory rhetoric is seen as likely to boost economic activity and price/wage levels in the US.<br><br>
        Trends in global capital markets included a rapid recovery in equity markets, many of which forged ahead to new highs, and a sharp sell-off in bond markets on the expectation of higher inflation, interest rates and borrowing.<br><br>
        The election result reverberated through to the UK equity market, where signs of investor rotation away from ‘bond-proxy’ stocks and towards cyclicals were clear. The mid-cap FTSE250 Index posted a small 0.1% total return, significantly stronger than the -2.0% return from the FTSE100 Index. With the High Court ruling that article 50 cannot be triggered without consulting parliament, the latest Brexit twist saw sterling rally during November and removed some of the recent share price support for the international earners found in the large-cap FTSE100.<br><br>
        Economically sensitive stocks in the industrials sector were responsible for a large part of the mid-cap strength. This sector, which makes up a quarter of the mid-cap index but only 8% of the FTSE100, rose 1.1%, and the sub-sector of industrial engineering returned 4.3%.<br><br>
        The Fund has good allocations to both mid-caps and engineering stocks, which tend to be IP-rich and therefore possessing the type of intangible barrier to competition that our investment process seeks out. Among these, Rotork (+15.0%) and Weir Group (+6.4%) were notable risers. Both have exposure to energy markets, so received a boost in the form of rising oil prices, which moved higher to reflect the surprise OPEC agreement on production cuts. Actuator manufacturer Rotork also issued a trading update covering the four months from July through October. While it described trends in underlying trading as unchanged against a backdrop of market conditions which remain challenging, it has benefitted significantly from currency gains. Third quarter revenue increased 5% in constant currency terms but by more than 22% in reported terms. The company now estimates the currency tailwind it is receiving to be greater than previously expected and, as such, was able to guide towards the upper end of market expectations for full year revenue and profit. Oil price strength also benefitted portfolio holdings in the oil &amp; gas sector, including Wood Group (+7.0%) and Royal Dutch Shell (+1.7%).<br><br>
        The Fund’s portfolio includes stocks, such as the engineers mentioned above, whose profitability is geared to temporary accelerations and decelerations in demand growth. It also includes many whose revenue and profit profiles are much steadier. Some stocks within the latter group suffered in November as, in our view, market trends failed to distinguish between true bond proxies and high-quality steady growth stocks. The former includes sectors such as utilities, which fell 8.8% in November, whose constituent companies have very moderate growth prospects and regulated asset bases. The latter includes pharmaceutical and consumer goods stocks which typically possess significant intangible assets, particularly in the form of IP and distribution networks. The Fund’s detractors in November included a selection from these areas: AstraZeneca (-9.6%),<br><br>
        Diageo (-8.0%), Reckitt Benckiser (-7.5%), Unilever (-6.5%) and GlaxoSmithKline (-6.5%). AstraZeneca’s share price fall was accentuated by the release of Q3 results which were weaker than anticipated, showing the effects of generic competition to its Crestor treatment for high cholesterol.<br><br>
        The Fund’s best and worst performing individual stocks were Tullett Prebon (+25.3%) and Craneware (-16.2%).<br><br>
        A Q3 trading statement from Tullett Prebon (+25.3%) revealed 15% growth in revenues to £216m. The majority of the increase can be accounted for by sterling weakness, as a large proportion of the company’s revenues are generated in US dollars. Constant currency growth was 4%, and Tullett Prebon stated that activity during the quarter was boosted by the volatility associated with political uncertainty and speculation around the potential for further interest rate increases. Later in the month it also received approval from the Financial Conduct Authority for its acquisition of ICAP’s voice broking business.<br><br>
        Craneware (-16.2%) fell due to concerns over the impact of potential changes to Obamacare. However, at its AGM on the same day of the US election result, the company did reaffirm its belief in the US healthcare market’s shift towards the IT solutions which it provides. It states that its sales pipeline is giving it high levels of revenue visibility, and that a favourable market backdrop underpins its long-term growth trajectory.<br><br><b>

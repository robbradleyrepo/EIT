        <strong>For investment professionals only</strong><br>
        <br>
        Bitter feuding between Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton in the US election run up dominated newsflow in&nbsp;October, although, as yet, market volatility remains muted.<br>
        <br>
        Such economic uncertainty – on top of the Brexit situation – would typically suggest a move into capital preservation mode but while equities continue to yield more than bonds, fixed income investors are starting to&nbsp;suffer losses.<br>
        <br>
        We have been long-term bond bears but would stop short of claiming the rising yields seen in recent weeks&nbsp;heralds the start of the long-awaited rotation out of the asset class.<br>
        <br>
        Most asset allocators have been underweight fixed income for some time and most of the current buyers are&nbsp;forced buyers via QE; with that in mind, we cannot see a huge swathe of investors simply dumping bonds. We&nbsp;have seen yields back up before, only to resume their multi-year bull trend, but the current decline does feel&nbsp;like it may be something of an inflexion point.<br>
        <br>
        UK gilts experienced one of the biggest moves with 10-year yields moving from 0.76% to 1.24% over the month&nbsp;– not as huge a shift but potentially enough to trouble their safe haven status. As a standalone asset class,&nbsp;government bonds is one of the most expensive ever but investors have continued to hold them for&nbsp;diversification and downside protection benefits. Following the post-referendum fall in the pound however, we&nbsp;are seeing imported inflation and rising rate expectations – meaning bondholders are beginning to suffer capital&nbsp;losses.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;With that in mind, investors have to look to other means of generating income and low-volatility returns, with&nbsp;options including real estate, long/short equity strategies and strategic bond funds.<br>
        <br>
        Elsewhere, monetary easing seems to be waning in favour of fiscal policy and we believe a cut in VAT could be&nbsp;one potential measure to stave off any eventual Brexit blues.<br>
        <br>
        As stated, volatility remains low considering the level of economic uncertainty and investors seem focused on&nbsp;the bigger picture, particularly when the Federal Reserve might raise rates again. The oil price stabilised over&nbsp;October and equities appear to have plateaued at current levels, after a fairly tepid October.<br>
        <br>
        We remain patient in terms of putting money back into markets – having trimmed back exposure pre-Brexit –&nbsp;although there are obvious expensive (US, UK) and cheaper (Europe, Japan) areas at present. Despite our long-standing&nbsp;aversion to fixed income, there is also value to be found in global bonds as an anti-globalisation trade&nbsp;continues to play out and a range of economies move in different directions.<br>
        <br>
        Looking globally, the IMF and OECD published estimates for world growth last month and both marked down&nbsp;estimates made as recently as the summer. The IMF is predicting GDP growth of 3.4% and the OECD 3.2%, with&nbsp;the UK providing headaches for forecasters as most have no idea what the next few years will bring. While&nbsp;Theresa May has confirmed plans to trigger Article 50 by March 2017, stimulating Britain’s official exit from the&nbsp;EU, few would be brave enough to predict how markets might behave before and after that date.

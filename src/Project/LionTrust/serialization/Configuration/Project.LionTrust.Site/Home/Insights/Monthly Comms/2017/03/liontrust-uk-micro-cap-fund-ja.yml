        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Micro Cap Fund returned 1.3%* in January. The Fund does not have a formal benchmark, but for reference, the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index returned 1.2%, the FTSE AIM All-Share Index returned 4.7% and the average return of funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies sector was 2.5%.</strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p>As is usual for the Fund, notable contributors to performance were almost exclusively company newsflow-driven, with the exception of <strong>Croma Security Solutions Group</strong> (+44.4%) and <strong>D4t4 Solutions</strong> (-12.7%). Security specialist Croma enjoyed a bounce after a bout of share price weakness which lasted through the second half of 2016, helped by three of the directors demonstrating their faith in the company’s prospects by buying over £100,000 worth of stock in January. However, the opposite was true for D4t4 Solutions, a provider of products and services to help customers collect, manage and analyse big data, whose shares retraced some of their December bull run with no specific catalyst. </p>
        <p>During the month, several of the Fund’s holdings with December fiscal year-ends took the opportunity to update the market on trading performance for 2016. </p>
        <p>Investors warmed to <strong>Ergomed</strong> (+35.4%), which uses its profitable pharmaceutical services business to underpin a lower-risk approach to investing in drug co-development. The company delivered 26% revenue growth in 2016 (aided by FX), with new contracts worth £42m won during the year (up 50% on 2015). </p>
        <p>Recruitment group <strong>Empresaria</strong> (+16.5%) also pleased the market by announcing that full year profitability is expected to be slightly ahead of expectations, with a 20% rise in net fee income translating into 23% growth in profit before tax. The business benefited from its geographical diversity, as solid performances in Germany, Asia and other regions served to offset weaker economic conditions in the Middle East and a degree of uncertainty in the UK around the EU referendum. </p>
        <p><strong>Quartix</strong> (-14.0%), a provider of vehicle telematics systems, also revealed that revenues for the year to December are expected to come in slightly ahead of expectations, while profitability remains in line. The shares nevertheless took a tumble on the back of the company’s deliberate decision to turn away lower-margin, lumpy sales to insurers in favour of focusing on higher-quality, recurring sales to its fleet customers. This strategy, coupled with a desire to increase investment in developing Quartix’s fleet business in the USA, led to short term forecast downgrades and the company now expects that 2017 results will be broadly flat year on year. </p>
        <p>E-learning specialist <strong>Learning Technologies Group</strong> (+29.7%), meanwhile, rose strongly on the back of its trading update, surprising the market with better-than-expected profitability. Importantly, the company confirmed that e-learning content had been delivered successfully to the UK Civil Service under a landmark contract won in December 2015, and that revenues from the contract have begun to accrue as expected. It also reaffirmed its commitment to pursuing acquisition opportunities in timely fashion: the company subsequently announced its £54m acquisition of talent management software provider NetDimensions shortly after the month end. </p>
        <p>Away from the full year trading updates, additional significant pieces of newsflow presented a mixed bag. Perhaps the biggest source of disappointment for the Fund during January was a trading statement and subsequent interim results released by patent attorney group <strong>Murgitroyd</strong> (-29.9%), which had a larger-than-average position within the portfolio (having received a low risk score upon investment). The company blamed a weaker-than-expected first half profit performance on increased business development, sales and marketing costs, which – compounded by the effects of lower-than-anticipated revenue growth – led to a 17% reduction in full year earnings estimates. </p>
        <p><strong>K3 Business Technology</strong> (-21.9%), a provider of enterprise resource planning software to the retail, manufacturing and distribution sectors, admitted that demand weakness in the important December sales period, coupled with an accelerating industry shift to recurring, cloud-based consumption models, would hit its prospects for the full year. Meanwhile, interim results from troubled electronic and physical security specialist <strong>Newmark Security</strong> (-14.3%) also made for sober reading, with the company partly blaming customer uncertainty in the run up to the Brexit vote for a drop off in order inflow. This weakness led to Newmark confirming it had fallen into loss for the half year to October, on the back of a 25% reduction in revenue. </p>
        <p>Better news came from financial planning and wealth management group <strong>Harwood Wealth Management</strong> (+30.2%), whose final results to October 2016 delivered 11% outperformance on broker forecasts at the EBITDA level. Assets under influence and management at the group grew 43% during the year to £2.1bn, thanks partly to a number of bolt on acquisitions completed using the proceeds of the March 2016 IPO. The company also declared a maiden dividend in respect of the year just ended, joining the list of over 80% of the Fund’s holdings which are already paying dividends to their investors despite their small size. </p>
        <p>The number of holdings in the Fund remained constant during January, with outgoing <strong>Keywords Studios</strong> replaced by <strong>Orchard Funding Group</strong>. Keywords, a provider of outsourced art, localisation and testing services to the video games industry, marked the Fund’s first exit from a position since its launch in March 2016. Having delivered an impressive return of over 150% since initial purchase, the company had more than exceeded the £250m market cap limit at which the Fund looks to make a managed exit, aiming to stay true to its roots as a dedicated micro cap investment vehicle. New addition Orchard Funding Group is a provider of loans to finance personal or commercial insurance premiums and professional services fees. This is an area of the market characterised by extremely low default rates, short durations and high margins, while the difficulty of building up embedded relationships with insurers presents a significant barrier to potential new entrants into the market. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span>Recent days have seen a multi-billion pound commitment to a &lsquo;green industrial revolution&rsquo; in the UK, with a 10-point plan including measures on offshore wind, nuclear energy, phasing out new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and banning gas boilers within new homes within three years. </span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>All of this is positive but we reiterate our view that much more is needed: with the UK required to halve carbon emissions every decade to meet Paris Accord targets by 2050, this means an annual reduction of at least 7% for the next 30 years. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>What these latest developments do show, however, is that change can happen very rapidly once better technology comes along, and these shifts look obvious after the event. We highlight the example of transport in New York: back in 1901, there were hundreds of thousands of horses pounding the streets and a photo from then shows a single anomaly in the shape of an early car. Just a decade later, however, this cheaper, cleaner and quicker transport solution had taken over and there was barely a horse to be seen <span style="color: black;">&ndash; and </span>we will<span style="color: black;"> see similar transitions from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric, and gas boilers to electric heat pumps.</span></span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Change can be non-linear and if you assume the future will look much like the present, you risk being very wrong. We believe it is important to focus on weaker signals, that single car-like thing in 1901, and imagine what if. All this leads to our Sustainable Investment philosophy, which is that most people underestimate the power and predictability of positive trends and the growth prospects of sustainable companies aligned with them.</span></p>

        <strong><span>Key Risks</span></strong></strong></span><strong><span style="color: black;"><br />
        </span></strong><br />
        Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital. The majority of the Liontrust Sustainable Future Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates. Some of these funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a higher element of risk due to less well-regulated markets and political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates. Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range and has a concentrated portfolio of securities, there is an increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and falls in the Fund&rsquo;s share price. Liontrust SF Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Corporate Bond Fund, Liontrust SF Cautious Managed Fund, Liontrust SF Defensive Managed Fund and Liontrust Monthly Income Bond Fund invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions, it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the bonds held by these funds. Mentioned above five funds can also invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interests rates move or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions.<br />

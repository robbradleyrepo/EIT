      Value: "The 11-strong Global Equity team headed by Robin Geffen manages 14 global income, regional and emerging markets funds and moved to Liontrust in October 2019 as part of the acquisition of Neptune Investment Management. The team has an average industry experience of 15 years. Robin has more than 40 years of investment experience having previously worked at Charterhouse J Rothschild, Eagle Star, York Trust Plc, Scottish Equitable and Orbitex Investments. The other managers of the Global Equity funds were all previously part of the investment team at Neptune as well. They believe the key to generating outperformance is through high conviction, long-term, research-led company selection and then apply their own approach to managing funds within this overarching framework."

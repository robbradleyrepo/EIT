      Value: "<p>Headed by James de Uphaugh, the Global Fundamental team has a strong track record of active management of equities for institutional, intermediaries and their clients since 2002. The team’s offering initially focused on UK equities but expanded in 2007 to include a global long/short equity fund and again in 2014 to include US, Global and International equities strategies. The appointment of James de Uphaugh as lead manager of the Edinburgh Investment Trust in 2020 demonstrates the reputation and investment acumen of the Global Fundamental team. Following the acquisition of Majedie Asset Management in 2022, the 16-strong team brought their funds and expertise to Liontrust.&nbsp;</p><div><br /></div>"

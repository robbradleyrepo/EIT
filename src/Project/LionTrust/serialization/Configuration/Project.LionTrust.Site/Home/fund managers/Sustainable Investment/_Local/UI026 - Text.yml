      Value: "The 17-strong team has been managing the Sustainable Future (SF) funds for more than 21 years.&nbsp; A key differentiator is the fact all the sustainable elements are fully integrated within a single team. The team, which has an average of 14 years of industry experience, is headed by Peter Michaelis, who was previously Head of SRI at Aviva Investors and has been managing the SF funds since launch. The fund managers all joined from Alliance Trust Investments (ATI) as part of its acquisition and were previously running the Sustainable Future fund range at Aviva Investors. The other lead equity managers are Simon Clements (who was formerly Head of Global Equities at Aviva Investors) along with Martyn Jones and Chris Foster who joined the management training programme at ATI as graduates. Fixed Income investments are headed by Stuart Steven, who was formerly Investment Director at Scottish Widows Investment Partnership. Stuart’s co-managers are Kenny Watson (formerly at Ignis Asset Management), along with Aitken Ross and Jack Willis who also started their careers in the graduate scheme at ATI. Harriet Parker leads on engagement activities across the team."

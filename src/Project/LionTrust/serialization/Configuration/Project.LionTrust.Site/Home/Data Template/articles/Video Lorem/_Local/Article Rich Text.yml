        <p>This was the worst 12 months Britain had seen since a catastrophic winter more than 300 years ago &ndash; dubbed Le Grand Hiver in France &ndash; which laid waste to much of Europe, from Italy to eastern Russia. In the early part of 1709, the continent effectively froze, literally overnight on 6 January, and stayed that way for several months: people were skating on the canals of Venice, lagoons turned to ice in the Mediterranean, bells broke when rung and travellers could apparently cross the Baltic Sea on horseback. With temperatures as low as -15&deg;C for a protracted period, this was the coldest winter in the last 500 years; British meteorologist William Derham wrote, &lsquo;I believe the Frost was greater (if not more universal also) than any other within the Memory of Man&rsquo;.</p>
        <p>One of the most commonly posited reasons for this is a phenomenon called the Maunder Minimum, which happened between 1645 and 1715 and is described by NASA as a time when the sun entered a quiet phase. With less activity across the surface of our primary heat source, temperatures basically dropped across everything on which the sun was shining.</p>
        <p>In other tales &ndash; some likely apocryphal, all apocalyptic &ndash; trees exploded as their sap froze, flocks of birds died in mid-air and plunged to the ground, and people turned to blocks of ice in their beds and were impossible to move. What cannot be denied, with grim echoes of the last year, is that this extreme cold, followed by food shortages and outbreaks of flu and plague, caused hundreds of thousands of deaths.</p>
        <p>In the UK, the Great Frost gave rise to one of the largest fairs ever on the River Thames, which had become a &lsquo;solid rock of ice&rsquo; according to one newspaper, as Londoners gathered to drink, skate and make merry. This did not last, however, and when the ice finally thawed, widespread flooding was hugely damaging for a largely agricultural economy. Crops were destroyed, grain prices soared and many communities were faced with starvation and ruin. All in all, figures suggest per capita GDP dropped by close to a quarter &ndash; overall GDP was down 13.3% in 1709 and 9.1% in 1710 after a 15.3% War of the Spanish Succession-driven decline in 1706 &ndash; and did not fully recover for a decade.</p>

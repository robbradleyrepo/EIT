        High yield bond interest payments are also non-negotiable, unlike equity dividends, making it a very dependable source of income. We continue to believe core, quality high yield has excellent risk/reward characteristics versus other potential homes for your hard-earned cash.

        Entering my twelfth calendar year as a manager of high yield bond funds, it is hard to gauge exactly how much of a good long-term track record is luck and how much is skill. Starting off in 2010 as I did, enormous support for credit markets has been in place throughout; we have been running with a tailwind for the entire race.
        Rarely has the ‘central bankers have our back’ trade been more evident than in the second half of 2020. Despite fairly sizeable uncertainty, the weakest companies and bonds in our market rallied hard, with CCCs producing a return of over 18%, vastly outperforming BBs.

        <p>
        Today, the difference in spread, the credit risk premium, between the average BB and CCC is around 5.5%, versus a ten-year average of around 7.5%. The lowest this has been in the last decade is a little over 4%. In other words, if we judge the high yield market by its weakest links, it is telling us the economic outlook is about as rosy as it gets.

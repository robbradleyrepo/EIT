        <p>Signs of life have emerged this year as the Nikkei breached 30,000 for the first time in three decades in February, and Japan was among the world’s most resilient economies in 2020, with its 4.8% contraction less than half the 9.9% in the UK. Japanese equities are currently rated a four on our target tactical asset allocation (with one the most bearish and five the most bullish), and we see several attractions for what remains a cheap market – albeit with potential Covid-19 and vaccine red flags to keep in mind.</p>
        <p>Japan has a large proportion of old economy cyclical and value businesses and its broad exposure to industrials and exporters means the country is well placed amid an ongoing global rebound and reflation. US bond yields are starting to rise after a long period of decline and the general perception is that this tends to benefit old-economy names and penalise growth, or long duration, stocks. Areas like technology are thought to be under greater threat as they rely on future earnings and are therefore more vulnerable to an increase in the bond yield used to discount those earnings.</p>
        <p>Taking a broader view, the corporate regime change ushered in by former prime minister Shinzo Abe’s Abenomics programme has been effective in pulling Japan out of its long slump, particularly the third structural reform ‘arrow’. Abe was forced to step down last year due to ill health but his successor Yoshihide Suga is keeping the fundamentals of Abenomics intact and bringing greater focus to the country’s growth strategy backed by a digital revolution – although it should be noted he has an election to fight by October and his popularity is waning as Covid cases rise.</p>
        <p>On that digital theme, transforming the current low penetration rate in areas like e-commerce is a potential growth driver and, without resorting to clichés, this slow adoption is likely to be down to demographics, with Japan’s population by far the oldest in the world. As the following chart shows, almost a third (more than 35 million people) are aged over 65 and there are 2.3 million in their 90s and over 70,000 centenarians. To bring things full circle, this situation was one of the primary motivating factors behind Abenomics in the first place, with the policies ultimately designed to boost the low GDP and diminishing productivity rate inherent with an ageing population.</p>

        <p><strong>The Fund&rsquo;s A5 share class returned 0.5%* in euro terms in October (A4 share class 0.5%). This compares with the 2.1% return from the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index.</strong></p>
        <p>The macro highlight of the month was the European Central Bank revealing its strategy on the winding down of its quantitative easing programme. The bank extended QE to September 2018, with monthly asset purchases planned to fall from &euro;60bn to &euro;30bn in January 2018. However, the ECB&rsquo;s governing council stated that it stood ready to increase QE once again if the economic outlook becomes less favourable. President Mario Draghi specified in his press conference that the move by the ECB was a &ldquo;downsizing&rdquo; rather than a tapering, which he said was not discussed by the governing council at the meeting. The ECB also maintained that interest rates are expected to remain at present levels well past the end of the asset purchase programme. The euro declined 1.2% in trade weighted terms and bond yields in the UK and Europe fell after the Bank&rsquo;s announcement while European stocks gained.</p>
        <p>Energy stocks stood out following a rise in oil prices as Brent oil broke US$61 a barrel, reaching its highest level since July 2015 as a result of improving confidence in the effectiveness of Opec supply cuts. The MSCI Europe Index&rsquo;s energy sector was the best performer, rising 5.5% in euro terms. <strong>Fred Olsen Energy </strong>(+73.0%) and <strong>Hunting </strong>(+10.9%) were the Fund&rsquo;s long book holdings which benefitted the most.</p>
        <p>IT (+4.6%) and materials (+3.9%) were also top performing sectors in the MSCI Europe. However, the Fund&rsquo;s holdings in the materials sector were a source of negative attribution due to weak performances from <strong>Ferrexpo </strong>(-12.7%), <strong>Evraz </strong>(-7.5%) and <strong>Lenzing </strong>(-5.3%).</p>
        <p>London-listed iron pellet producer Ferrexpo reported that production in the first nine months of 2017 fell 8.1% year-on-year, with third quarter production declining 1.7% quarter-on-quarter. The company stated the lower production reflected its ongoing pellet line maintenance programme. Despite the decline this month, Ferrexpo has performed strongly since purchase in May (+67%). Russian steel maker Evraz&rsquo;s shares declined despite reporting a 5.9% quarterly rise in crude steel output in the third quarter of the year. </p>
        <p><strong>Bergman &amp; Beving </strong>(-13.9%) was another stock to decline in October. The construction and manufacturing company stated earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) fell 27% year-on-year in the company&rsquo;s second quarter to the end of September 2017. This included a decline in the operating margin to 6.4% from 9.3% in the second quarter last year as a result of lower revenue and investments in growth.</p>
        <p>Outside of energy stocks, <strong>Advanced Medical Solutions </strong>(+20.1%) was among the top gainers. The surgical and advanced wound care specialist announced that it had entered into an out-licensing agreement with Organogenesis Inc for a collagen-based wound dressing. Organogenesis will be granted a US patent for which it will pay Advanced Medical Solutions a minimum of US$2.5m in 2017 and US$1m in 2018 and 2019 as part of ongoing royalty to the end of the patent in October 2026.</p>
        <p><strong>Momentum Group</strong>&rsquo;s (+17.0%) second quarter as an independent company showed growth in both revenue and operating profit. The company, which provides equipment and services to the industrial and construction sectors, added that market conditions in the Swedish and Finnish manufacturing industry have been favourable and there have been more positive developments in Norway, where conditions had been more challenging. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Fred Olsen Energy (+73.0%), Advanced Medical Solutions (+20.1%) and Momentum Group (+17.0%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included:</strong></p>
        <p>Bergman &amp; Beving (-13.9%), Ferrexpo (-12.7%) and Peab (-10.6%).</p>

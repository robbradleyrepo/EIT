        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned 3.7%* in October, compared with the 1.7% return from the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index. </strong></p>
        <p>The Fund outpaced the FTSE Small Cap (ex-IT) in what was a broadly positive UK market environment in October. One of the best returns this month was delivered by email marketing automation software provider <strong>dotdigital Group </strong>(+27.0%) which reported a 30% jump in pretax profit for the year to end June 2017, along with a 19% rise in revenue. As one of the intangible assets we look for in companies, we were pleased to see recurring revenue increased to 81% from 78% last year. Milan Patel, the company&rsquo;s chief executive, added that the first few months of the company&rsquo;s new financial year have been in line with expectations and the market continues to grow robustly.</p>
        <p>However, <strong>System1 Group </strong>(-21.4%), which helps advertising departments measure the effectiveness of their output, did not enjoy the same fortunes as it reported a set of unexpectedly disappointing interim results. Having warned earlier in the month that the first half of its financial year had been slow, the group revealed a 10% year-on-year decline in revenue and a 9% fall in gross profit. The company attributed the performance to three main issues: several fast moving consumer goods companies cutting or deferring their marketing budgets, a shift in the market towards automated lower cost research data and a reorganisation within the company itself following its rebranding from BrainJuicer. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Learnings Technologies Group </strong>(+19.3%) shares jumped at the beginning of the month after it announced in a short statement that the financial impact from one of its major contracts will be accelerated in 2017. This will mean that financial results for 2017 will be ahead of expectations. The statement followed a strong set of interim results in September, which showed a 68% increase in revenue to &pound;21.5m. </p>
        <p><strong>Craneware</strong> (+18.7%) was another strong performer after it announced a renewal and &ldquo;significant expansion&rdquo; of a contract with a US hospital operator. The deal is worth US$6m, over half of which represents an expansion of the existing contract to cover new hospitals in the network. Investors welcomed the news and bid the shares higher ahead of an AGM update scheduled for November.</p>
        <p>Shares in big data analytics company <strong>First Derivatives </strong>(+20.7%) ascended before the release of its interim results due in November. The company also benefited from increased interest in its Kx technology from outside of its main markets in the financial sector, with deals announced with the European Space Agency, BrainWaveBank and others. </p>
        <p><strong>Smart Metering Systems </strong>(+16.5%) did not release any significant newsflow in October but its shares continued to rebound following interim results in September where it reported a small decline in pre-tax profit. Similarly, <strong>Netcall </strong>(-18.6%) did not issue any corporate accounts during the month but the customer engagement software firm&rsquo;s shares remained under pressure as investors digested the impact of its acquisition of low code software development platform MatsSoft in August. The acquisition coincided with an underlying downgrade to analyst forecasts as the company transitions to a software as a service revenue from a traditional licence based model. </p>
        <p>The biggest faller this month was <strong>Lombard Risk Management </strong>(-34.9%). The regulatory reporting services company saw its loss widen to &pound;5.9m in the first half of its financial year from &pound;0.1m at the same time last year. Revenue declined 16.4% largely due to a temporary fall in services revenue and delays in contract signings. However, management remained upbeat on the second half of the year, noting that the size and quality of its pipeline is at an all-time high. </p>
        <p><strong>James Cropper</strong>&rsquo;s<strong> </strong>(-12.8%) shares declined after it reiterated that the increase in pulp prices was impacting its paper business but maintained that other businesses are trading well and it expects to meet expectations for the current financial year. </p>
        <p>There was one change to the Fund in October with Quarto Group exiting the Fund as management ownership fell below our 3% requirement. </p>

The issue of units/shares in Liontrust Funds may be subject to an initial charge, which will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term.

        <p> &bull; Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</p>

        <p><strong>The Fund returned 1.4%* in sterling terms in October, compared with the 1.5% return from the MSCI Europe ex-UK index.</strong></p>
        <p>The macro highlight of the month was the European Central Bank revealing its strategy on the winding down of its quantitative easing programme. The bank extended QE to September 2018, with monthly asset purchases planned to fall from &euro;60bn to &euro;30bn in January 2018. However, the ECB&rsquo;s governing council stated that it stood ready to increase QE once again if the economic outlook becomes less favourable. President Mario Draghi specified in his press conference that the move by the ECB was a &ldquo;downsizing&rdquo; rather than a tapering, which he said was not discussed by the governing council at the meeting. The ECB also maintained that interest rates are expected to remain at present levels well past the end of the asset purchase programme. The euro declined 1.2% in trade weighted terms and bond yields in the UK and Europe fell after the Bank&rsquo;s announcement while European stocks gained.</p>
        <p>Energy stocks stood out following a rise in oil prices as Brent oil broke US$61 a barrel, reaching its highest level since July 2015 as a result of improving confidence in the effectiveness of Opec supply cuts. The MSCI Europe ex-UK Index&rsquo;s energy sector was amongst the biggest gainers, rising 4.0% in sterling terms. <strong>Fred Olsen Energy</strong> (+72.3%) and <strong>Total </strong>(+4.9%) were among the Fund&rsquo;s holdings to benefit from higher oil prices. IT (+4.2%) and utilities (+3.7%) were also top performing sectors in the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index. Health care (-1.9%), telecoms (-1.2%) and financials (-0.8%) were the worst performers.</p>
        <p>Among the Fund&rsquo;s other holdings, polymer manufacturer <strong>Covestro</strong> (+13.2%) was a top contributor. The company announced the strongest quarter in its history with net income rising 90% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2017 and group sales up 17%. Covestro attributed the performance to ongoing robust demand in its main industries and a positive margin performance particularly in its Polyurethanes business. Additionally, the company unveiled a share buyback of up to &euro;1.5bn.</p>
        <p><strong>Stora Enso </strong>(+11.9%) reported upbeat third quarter results, which came in ahead of consensus estimates. The paper and packaging company stated operational earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rose 32% to &euro;290m, beating the market forecast of &euro;269m. However, the company noted that fourth quarter EBIT is expected to be lower or in line with this level.</p>
        <p>Finnish pharmaceutical company <strong>Orion</strong> (-10.7%) was a notable faller after its results for the first nine months of 2017 showed a 14% year-on-year fall in operating profit. It noted this was partly due to the decline in sales in its Parkinson&rsquo;s drugs business and changes made to the pricing system for prescription drugs in Finland. Net sales in the third quarter of the year fell below analyst estimates.</p>
        <p><strong>Liberbank</strong>&rsquo;s (-9.3%) share price dropped after it revealed further details of a &euro;500m rights issue. The rights issue was first announced by the Spanish lender in September to bolster its financial reserves as it aims to continue reducing its bad loan ratio. The Fund received an allocation of rights in Liberbank shares as part of the company&rsquo;s corporate action.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors to performance included: </strong></p>
        <p>Fred Olsen Energy (+72.3%), Covestro (+13.2%) and Stora Enso (+11.9%). </p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors to performance included: </strong></p>
        <p>JM (-15.1%), Peab (-11.1%) and Orion (-10.7%).</p>

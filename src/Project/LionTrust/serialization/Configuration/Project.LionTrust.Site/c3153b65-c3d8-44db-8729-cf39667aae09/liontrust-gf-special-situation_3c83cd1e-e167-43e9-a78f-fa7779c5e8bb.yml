        <p><strong>The Liontrust GF Special Situations Fund returned 3.0%* in October compared with the 1.9% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></p>
        <p>The UK market made broad-based gains with the FTSE 250 Index (+2.0%) and FTSE Small Cap Index (+2.3%) edging the FTSE100 Index return (+1.8%) and sectors showing some continuation of last month&rsquo;s trend for cyclicals to outperform more defensive areas. </p>
        <p>A not inconsiderable proportion of the market&rsquo;s rise can be attributed to a rally in the oil price, as Brent rose to over US$61 a barrel by month-end. <strong>Royal Dutch Shell </strong>(B shares +5.5%)<strong> </strong>and <strong>BP </strong>(+6.9%) made market cap-weighted monthly contributions to the FTSE All-Share Index of +42bps and +27bps respectively. By contrast, the biggest stock specific drag on the index was <strong>GlaxoSmithKline </strong>(-8.8%) which presented a 27bps headwind after in-line Q3 numbers and the maintenance of its full year outlook was insufficient to provide the shares with fresh impetus and reverse the recent relative weakness experienced by the pharmaceuticals sector.&nbsp; With holdings in all three stocks, the net impact on attribution relative to the index was minimal.</p>
        <p>Overall, the Fund outstripped the index return, helped by some impressive returns for some of its mid-cap and small-cap holdings. Foremost among these was <strong>Craneware</strong> (+18.7%), which announced a renewal and &ldquo;significant expansion&rdquo; of a contract with a US hospital operator. The deal is worth US$6m, over half of which represents an expansion of the existing contract to cover new hospitals. Investors welcomed the news and bid the shares higher ahead of an AGM update scheduled for November </p>
        <p>October was an eventful month for <strong>RWS Holdings</strong> (+13.2%) which released a trading statement covering the year to 30 September before announcing a US$320m acquisition. The company expects adjusted profit before tax to be ahead of market expectations, boosted by growth in its core translation activities, gross margin expansion and positive currency effects.&nbsp; RWS Holdings has an acquisitive history, having completed the purchase of CTi in November 2015 and LUZ in February 2017 to form the RWS Life Sciences division. It has now announced the purchase of Moravia, a provider of technology-enabled localisation services, to create a third division which is expected to contribute around a third of RWS&rsquo;s profits. Of the deal consideration, &pound;185m was raised via a placing at 425p (a 20%+ discount to the prevailing share price).</p>
        <p>Following signs of a deceleration in sales growth earlier this year, investors in <strong>Domino&rsquo;s Pizza Group</strong> (+8.2%) welcomed news of a 12% organic sales increase in Q3. Overall, sales grew 21% with the company describing a &ldquo;broad-based uplift&rdquo;. Domino&rsquo;s Pizza opened 18 new UK stores in the quarter, taking it through the 1,000 store mark, and lifting its 2017 openings total to 58. It still expects to open 90 stores in total in 2017, although it now expects its capex to be at the lower end of its &pound;50m - &pound;60m prior guidance. This, in combination with the strength of recent trading, allowed it to state that full year underlying profit before tax should be &ldquo;at least in line&rdquo; with market expectations. </p>
        <p>Instrumentation and controls specialist <strong>Spectris</strong> (+7.0%) shuffled its portfolio of business units, completing the sale of Microscan Systems for &pound;123m and acquiring Omnicon for an initial consideration of US$29m. The purchase is expected to strengthen the company&rsquo;s Test and Measurement division with industries such as aerospace &amp; defence and autos. </p>
        <p>Aside from<strong> </strong>GlaxoSmithKline,<strong> PageGroup </strong>(-6.1%) was the other significant detractor to issue newsflow of note. The recruiter generated gross profit growth of 8.8% in constant currency terms in Q3. The rise was driven by Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa, which accounts for 45% of the group total, but the UK suffered a 7.6% fall as business and individual confidence levels were hit by Brexit uncertainty. </p>
        <p>A short Q3 trading update from <strong>StatPro Group </strong>(-5.0%) outlined that it remains confident in hitting its full year targets for revenue and profits. The company is transitioning its asset management software to cloud-based delivery and 83% of group annualised recurring revenue is now Software-as-a-Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p>Craneware (+18.7%), Smart Metering Systems (+16.5%), RWS Holdings (+13.2%), Intertek Group (+8.9%) and Spectris (+7.0%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors included:</strong></p>
        <p>Bango (-12.0%), GlaxoSmithKline (-8.8%), Next Fifteen Communications (-7.4%), PageGroup (-6.1%) and Brooks Macdonald Group (-5.0%).</p>

        <p> &bull; Some of the Funds managed by the Economic Advantage team invest in smaller companies and companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market.&nbsp; These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. The performance of the Liontrust GF UK Growth Fund may differ from the performance of the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and is likely to be lower than its corresponding Master Fund due to additional fees and expenses.</p>

        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund returned 2.7%* in sterling terms in January, compared with the 0.6% return from the MSCI Europe ex-UK index.</strong></p>
        <p>The ‘Trump Trade’<em> </em>seen in markets in the second half of last year continued in the US in January: the S&amp;P 500 Index rose 1.9% (US dollar terms), again reaching a new peak of 2298 on 25 January. However in Europe, the mood was more subdued with the MSCI Europe Index falling in euro terms. The pound fell 0.7% against the euro, perhaps driven by comments from Theresa May regarding the EU single market that raised the prospect of ‘Hard Brexit’, and this allowed the MSCI Europe Index to make a positive return in sterling terms.</p>
        <p>Against this backdrop, sector performance was mixed across the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index. In a familiar pattern, materials and financials were among the strongest performing sectors, up 2.6% and 2.1% respectively. However, in contrast to the trend seen in recent months, energy underperformed the market, falling 4.2%. Having rallied on the back of the OPEC production cut announcement in November last year, the sector may now be seeing some profit-taking triggered by a recent Energy Industry Report from the EIA which showed an unexpected build up in crude inventories. The Brent oil price itself fell slightly, down 2%. Other weak sectors during the month included real estate (-4.5%) and utilities (-3.3%), possibly reflecting their bond proxy characteristics. </p>
        <p>As equity markets reached new highs in some regions, US debt markets were broadly unchanged by month end with the yield on US 10 year Treasury bills rising just 1bp overall to 2.45%. In contrast, the yield on the German 10 year bund rose strongly, up 23bps during the month to 0.45%.&nbsp; Similarly, UK 10 year gilt yields rose 18bps to 1.42%. </p>
        <p>Shares in Swiss pharma company Actelion (+17.5%) jumped on the confirmation that it had agreed to a $280/share all-cash takeover offer from Johnson &amp; Johnson after a long pursuit. Actelion shareholders are also eligible for shares in a new R&amp;D company that will be spun out prior to the takeover. Both Norsk Hydro (+16.7%) and Granges (+14.9%) were lifted by a rally in aluminium prices – the LME 3 month contract rose 7% to $1819/tonne. There has been speculation that Chinese authorities are looking to scale back aluminium production capacity. </p>
        <p>The Fund’s oil &amp; gas stocks lost some ground in January as the spot price edged lower. Tethys Oil (-4.3%), OMV (-3.2%) and Total (-3.8%) were among those affected, but Fred Olsen suffered the biggest drop, down over 40%. Its exposure to weakness in the energy sector was exaggerated due to the extent of its share price rally last month (when terms on its debt were successfully renegotiated). Vopak (-11.1%) is another portfolio holding in the sector; its shares suffered from speculation that backwardation of the oil futures market may lead to a decline in demand for its oil and gas storage services. </p>
        <p>Red Electrica de Espana (-6.1%) lost an appeal against the imposition of ‘public domain’ charges by certain Spanish councils on the land used for electricity distribution assets. </p>
        <p>Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology was sold out of the portfolio and replaced by Mediobanca. Following Banco Popolare’s merger with Banco Popolare di Milano, the combined entity is now named Banco BPM. </p>

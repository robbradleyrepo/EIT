        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust GF Special Situations Fund returned 0.8%* in January compared with the -0.3% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></p>
        <p>UK equities began 2017 strongly, with large-caps leading the market higher. The FTSE 100 notched up 12 consecutive all-time closing highs around the turn of the year before peaking at 7,337 points on 13 January. In the second half of the month the strength shown in large-caps eroded, and they ended the month nursing a 0.6% loss. The mid and small cap segments of the market were stronger: the FTSE 250 Index returning 0.5% and the FTSE Small Cap Index gaining 1.4%.</p>
        <p>Trends in sterling were one factor contributing to the about-turn in large-cap performance. The pound initially extended its weakness, falling to a low of $1.20/&pound; mid-month. The prospect of a &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo; and the uncertainty surrounding the process of leaving the EU has weighed heavily on sterling over the last six months. As Theresa May&rsquo;s scheduled Brexit speech on 17 January approached, the currency weakness was exacerbated. Despite her confirmation that the UK would also be leaving the European single market, sterling then rallied strongly. It rose over 4% in the second half of the month, perhaps reflecting the fact that many of the negatives had already been priced in, as well as an element of relief on the removal of some uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Last year&rsquo;s weakness in traditionally defensive sectors carried over into the start of 2016, with healthcare&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (-3.9%), utilities (-2.2%), and telecoms (-8.4%) underperforming. The latter sector was not helped by the revelation of accounting irregularities at BT Group, its largest constituent, while healthcare remains exposed to volatility as a result of Donald Trump&rsquo;s various pronouncements on his approach to the pharmaceutical industry. The Fund&rsquo;s exposure included stocks such as AstraZeneca (-5.5%) and Shire (-6.5%).</p>
        <p>Over 60% of the Fund is invested outside of the FTSE100, so January&rsquo;s modest gains lower down the market cap scale provided a fairly benign environment for the Fund&rsquo;s holdings. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>One of the Fund&rsquo;s biggest risers in January was Globaldata (+23.3%), an AIM-listed smaller company which issued no new company statements January. </p>
        <p>Metrology specialist Renishaw (+12.7%) registered 21% revenue growth to &pound;240m in the six months to 31 December 2016, of which 9% was the effect of currency translation gains. Sales grew in all regions and were particularly strong in its Far East division, up 27%, and the UK, rising 20%. The company commented on the strength of sales growth in its encoder and laser calibration products lines. Renishaw maintained guidance for revenue of &pound;500m to &pound;530m in the full year to 31 June 2017 and profit before tax of &pound;85m to &pound;105m. The midpoint of this sales range implies 20% growth over the year. </p>
        <p>A full year trading update from estate agent Savills (+10.7%) referred to &ldquo;a strong finish to the year&rdquo; which has led it to up its guidance. In the UK a reduction in transactions had been expected, but this was offset by increased overseas interest in commercial and high-end residential properties as a result of the EU referendum result. As well as benefitting from sterling weakness, Savills stated it had seen significant volumes of commercial and residential transactions. Due to ongoing risks to the economic outlook, the company chose to leave its 2017 forecast unchanged. </p>
        <p>Heading the portfolio detractors in January was AA (-12.0%). Newsflow from the company has been very light since its early-October interims, leaving it susceptible to a broker price target cut ahead of its full year trading update in February. </p>
        <p>Although a trading update from software provider EMIS Group (-8.5%) stated that its performance in the second half of the year was in line with expectations, it commented that the operating environment is becoming increasingly difficult due to &ldquo;severe pressures on NHS funds&rdquo;. Shares in the company gave up some ground as investors factored in the cautious outlook. EMIS believes that its order book and strong recurring revenue visibility gives it a sound base from which to face these headwinds. While at the operational level progress has been solid, the company is in a transitional phase with regard to its leadership and structure. Its CEO is due to retire by the end of 2017, with a successor currently being sought, and the company has now initiated an internal restructuring to bring together its Primary, Community and Secondary Care divisions to align with the NHS&rsquo; requirement for integrated solutions. The reorganisation is expected to be largely complete by the end of March. </p>
        <p>Following completion of its disposal of voice broking business to Tullet Prebon (now TP ICAP) at the end of December, shares in NEX Group (formerly ICAP) rose through January. &nbsp;A corporate action saw NEX Group shareholders receive 0.47 new shares in TP ICAP before a 4-for-7 consolidation of NEX Group shares was effected. As shareholders in both companies, the Fund&rsquo;s overall economic interest was largely unaffected by the transaction.</p>
        <p>Bond International Software exited the portfolio. The company delisted from AIM in December 2016, having agreed the sale of both its recruitment software subsidiaries (following a somewhat protracted bidding war) and, separately, its real estate assets. The disposal proceeds net of costs from its voluntary liquidation were returned to investors in January. </p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p>Globaldata (+23.3%), NEX Group (+15.6%), Renishaw (+12.7%), Hargreaves Lansdown (+11.5%) and Savills (+10.7%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors included:</strong></p>
        <p>AA (-12.0%), EMIS Group (-8.5%), BP (-7.2%), Shire (-6.5%) and AstraZeneca (-5.5%).</p>
        <p> *Financial Express, as at 31.01.17, total return C1 retail share class.&nbsp;</p>

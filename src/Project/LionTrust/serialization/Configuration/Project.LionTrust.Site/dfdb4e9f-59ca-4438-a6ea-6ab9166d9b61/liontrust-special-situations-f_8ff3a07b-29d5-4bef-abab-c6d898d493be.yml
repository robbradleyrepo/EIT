        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>The Liontrust Special Situations Fund returned 3.2%* in February, compared with the 3.1% return from the FTSE All-Share Index.</strong></span></p>
        <p>UK equities sustained their strong start to 2017, keeping pace with the rise in global equity markets: the MSCI World Index of developed markets rose 3.5%. Within this rally there was something of a recovery in relative terms for some defensive sectors which were left behind during the reflation rally in the second half of 2016. Healthcare (+6.2%) telecoms (+3.0%), and utilities (+1.8%) were among those sectors to benefit. </p>
        <p>The Fund&rsquo;s pharmaceutical sector holdings strengthened, helped by this improving investor sentiment towards the sector, as well as news flow from both AstraZeneca (+14.5%) and Shire (+10.8%).</p>
        <p>Shire&rsquo;s 2016 growth numbers (sales +78%) are flattered by the inclusion of Baxalta sales following the $32bn acquisition mid-way through the year. Ex-Baxalta, sales growth was still very robust at 15% and the results were marginally ahead of expectations.&nbsp; By contrast, AstraZeneca&rsquo;s 2016 numbers were slightly below consensus as revenues contracted 5% in constant currency terms due to the patent expiry of its Crestor drug. The company is, however, confident that it has a well-stocked late-stage pipeline which will offset the decline. Later in the month AstraZeneca announced positive results from a phase III trial for its Lynparza cancer treatment.</p>
        <p>The largest individual portfolio riser in February was Unilever (+19.3%). It received a bid approach from US consumer goods peer Kraft Heinz, which was quickly withdrawn as it became clear that Unilever was in no mood to entertain a friendly takeover. We have found takeover offers for Fund holdings to be a reasonably frequent feature which is reflective of the appeal others see in the core Economic Advantage assets which we seek out. In this instance, the failed deal appears to have triggered both accelerated action on behalf of Unilever&rsquo;s management and a reassessment of the company&rsquo;s prospects among investors. Since rejecting the approach, Unilever has announced the initiation of a &ldquo;comprehensive review&rdquo; of its business &ndash; due to complete in April &ndash; and upgraded guidance for 2017&rsquo;s core operating margin to the upper end of its prior forecast of 40-80 bps improvement. </p>
        <p>The oil &amp; gas sector of the FTSE All-Share weakened in February, falling 5.8%. Negative returns were experienced by selection of the Fund&rsquo;s oil &amp; gas exploration and production companies and industrial engineers with energy sector exposure. One of these stocks, Wood Group (-9.8%), released 2016 results showing a 16% contraction in revenue and 28% fall in operating profit in 2016 as activity levels remained subdued. Although oil prices have recovered some ground, the company still struck a very cautious tone with its outlook comments. It expects the oil &amp; gas market to continue to present challenges in 2017, with only modest recovery anticipated in selected areas. </p>
        <p>Having recovered sharply during January as investors took some contract wins as evidence of green shoots within its end oil &amp; gas markets, Plexus Holdings&rsquo; (-14.6%) trading statement led to it giving back some ground in February. Although the tone was undoubtedly negative, stating that revenues are &ldquo;materially behind expectations for the current financial year&rdquo;, CEO Ben Van Bilderbeek did give some cause for optimism: in his view &ldquo;the bottom of the cycle has now been reached&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Investors responded well to final results from Globaldata (+11.8%) which were ahead of market forecasts. The company reported 65% growth in revenues to top &pound;100m for the first time. It was a transformational year for the group, as it integrated two acquisitions in the consumer and healthcare verticals, rebranding the group to create a &ldquo;leading global business information company&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Sepura (-27.6%) remains in bid situation as the recommended cash offer from Hytera Communication continues to make its way through the lengthy competition approval process. The announcement that the German competition authorities would launch a Phase II investigation into the takeover heralded a fresh bout of uncertainty over the likelihood of the deal ultimately completing.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive contributors included: </strong></p>
        <p>Unilever (+19.3%), AstraZeneca (+14.5%), GlobalData (+11.8%), Shire (+10.8%) and GlaxoSmithKline (+9.4%).</p>
        <p><strong>Negative contributors included:</strong></p>
        <p>Sepura (-27.6%), Plexus Holdings (-14.6%), Wood Group (-9.8%), Iomart Group (-8.3%) and Craneware (-7.1%).</p>

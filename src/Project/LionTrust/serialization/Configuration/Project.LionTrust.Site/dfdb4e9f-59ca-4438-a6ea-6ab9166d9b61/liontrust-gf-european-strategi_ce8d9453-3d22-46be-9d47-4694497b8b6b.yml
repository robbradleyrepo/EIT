        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p>The Fund returned 1.5%* in euro terms in January, compared with the -0.4% return from the MSCI Europe Index and the 0.7% return of the HFRX Equity Hedge EUR Index. Net exposure at month end was c.61%. During the month, the Fund&rsquo;s exposure to the market was again modestly increased to reflect the more positive signal from our proprietary indicators. Despite the moderate weakness in European equities, it was strong performance from the Fund&rsquo;s long book which accounted for the entirety of its monthly gain; the short book made a small negative contribution.</p>
        <p>Political events dominated global news headlines during the month, with the Presidential inauguration to the fore in the US while Brexit developments were also a focus in the UK and Europe. The &lsquo;Trump Trade&rsquo;<em> </em>seen in markets in the second half of last year continued in the US in January: the S&amp;P 500 Index rose 1.9% (US dollar terms), again reaching a new peak of 2298 on the 25 January. However in Europe, the mood was more subdued with the MSCI Europe Index falling in January in euro terms, perhaps driven by uncertainty regarding the Brexit decision and related comments during the month from UK Prime Minister that a &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo; (i.e. the UK leaving the EU single market) was likely.</p>
        <p>Against this backdrop, sector performance was mixed across the MSCI Europe Index. In a familiar pattern, materials and financials were among the strongest performing sectors, up 3.8% and 0.8% respectively in euro terms. However, in contrast to the trend seen in recent months, energy lagged and indeed was the weakest performing sector during the month, declining 5.5%. Having rallied on the back of the OPEC production cut announcement in November last year, the sector may now be seeing some profit-taking triggered by a recent Energy Industry Report from the EIA which showed an unexpected build up in crude inventories. The other weakest sectors during the month included real estate (-4.3%) and utilities (-3.1%), possibly reflecting their bond proxy characteristics. Economic data on both sides of the Atlantic was mixed to mildly positive, and there was no policy change from the ECB following its regular Governing Council meeting.</p>
        <p>As equity markets reached new highs in some regions, US debt markets were broadly unchanged by the month end with the yield on US 10 year Treasury bills rising just 1bp overall to 2.45%. In contrast, the yield on the German 10 year bund rose strongly, up 23bps during the month to 0.45%.&nbsp; Similarly, UK 10 year gilt yields rose 18bps to 1.42%. A combination of modestly positive GDP and inflation data during the month contributed to the increase. Sterling rose by over 1% against the US dollar but declined 0.7% versus the euro. </p>
        <p>In the Fund&rsquo;s long book, the strongest performer was Burford Capital, the UK based litigation financing company. The rally in the shares continued rising a further 13% in January. As we highlighted last month, the shares have reacted positively to the announcement of the acquisition of US peer Gerchen Keller Capital. Shares in AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group, a specialty metals and vacuum furnace producer, also performed strongly during the month, rallying 16%. While there was no significant corporate news flow, the shares participated in the rise in the general metals, mining and materials sector. The long book also benefitted from other mining holdings, including Rio Tinto and Glencore, with the shares rallying 10% and 17% respectively during the month.</p>
        <p>There were no major negative contributors to the long book during the month. A modest negative contribution came from some holdings in the energy sector, which saw some profit taking as the price of Brent modestly declined (2%) over the month.</p>
        <p>One of the weakest individual short positions was in a UK recruitment company which published a trading update early in the month. The shares reacted positively as management commented that it expected to deliver full year results in line with market expectations and that demand in the Staffing business remained strong during the second half of the year. Later in the month, the company published its full year results which included a 29% rise in the annual dividend. A further detractor from performance was a US healthcare research and analysis company. Its shares rallied on a broker note highlighting a potential take-over scenario, most likely from the private equity sector. A well-known US activist investor has built a stake in the company.</p>

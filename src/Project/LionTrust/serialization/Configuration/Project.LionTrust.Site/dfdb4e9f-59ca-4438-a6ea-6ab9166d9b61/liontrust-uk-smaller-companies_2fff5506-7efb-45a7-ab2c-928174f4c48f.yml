        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Liontrust UK Smaller Companies Fund returned 3.7%* in January, compared with the 1.2% return from the FTSE Small Cap (excluding investment trusts) Index.</strong></p>
        <p>The majority of the Fund&rsquo;s largest movers in January &ndash; both positive and negative &ndash; had released trading updates relating to the period ending 31 December 2016. Bango (+47.4%), the Fund&rsquo;s largest riser in the month, was one of these. Its share price has provided a volatile ride for investors over the last six months. January&rsquo;s sharp rise was catalysed by a 2016 trading update in which it confirmed that annualised exit run-rate of End User Spend (its term for transaction value passing through its platform) at the end of the year was &pound;195m, well ahead of the &pound;67m at the end of 2015.</p>
        <p>An update from market research group Brainjuicer (+35.5%) detailed a very strong finish to 2016. Gross profit for the year rose 27%, almost half of which was currency gains, while normalised profit before tax grew 33% during the year. These numbers came in substantially above broker forecasts, which themselves had edged up as recently as December. Cashflow performance was also better than expected, with the group ending the year with &pound;7.8m of net cash, despite dividends and share buy backs during the year. The company&rsquo;s house broker upgraded its forecast for next year by 15% on the back of the momentum shown in the trading update.</p>
        <p>E-learning specialist Learning Technologies Group (+29.7%), meanwhile, rose strongly on the back of its trading update, surprising the market with better-than-expected profitability. Importantly, the company confirmed that e-learning content had been delivered successfully to the UK Civil Service under a landmark contract won in December 2015, and that revenues from the contract have begun to accrue as expected. It also reaffirmed its commitment to pursuing acquisition opportunities in timely fashion: the company subsequently announced its &pound;54m acquisition of talent management software provider NetDimensions shortly after the month end. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, not all portfolio trading updates were upbeat. A trading statement and subsequent interim results released by patent attorney group Murgitroyd (-29.9%) saw the company blame a weaker-than-expected first half profit performance on increased business development, sales and marketing costs, which &ndash; compounded by the effects of lower-than-anticipated revenue growth &ndash; led to a 17% reduction in full year earnings estimates. </p>
        <p>K3 Business Technology (-21.9%) was another notable detractor in January. The provider of enterprise resource planning software to the retail, manufacturing and distribution sectors, admitted that demand weakness in the important December sales period, coupled with an accelerating industry shift to recurring, cloud-based consumption models, would hit its prospects for the full year.</p>
        <p>Although the oil price gave up some ground in January, oil &amp; gas engineering services business Plexus Holdings (+37.3%) bounced sharply during the month. It announced the award of an order with Masirah Oil worth $285k for the use of its <em>POS-GRIP</em> wellhead technology at a second well offshore Oman. The deal further extends its diversification into new markets. The North Sea remains its core established market, and in January Plexus signed a four-year framework agreement with Centrica Norway to supply support services for jack up wells in the North Sea. Plexus stated that it sees the deal as a platform to tender for further Centrica business in other geographies and markets (such as sub-sea).</p>
        <p>Quartix (-14.0%), a provider of vehicle telematics systems, revealed that revenues for the year to December are expected to come in slightly ahead of expectations, while profitability remains in line. The shares nevertheless took a tumble on the back of the company&rsquo;s deliberate decision to turn away lower-margin, lumpy sales to insurers in favour of focusing on higher-quality, recurring sales to its fleet customers. This strategy, coupled with a desire to increase investment in developing Quartix&rsquo;s fleet business in the USA, led to short-term forecast downgrades and the company now expects 2017 results to be broadly flat year on year. </p>
        <p>Statpro (-8.6%) signed up another client for its portfolio management software in January &ndash; a South African asset manager which has committed to a contract with minimum value of &pound;1.5m. However, shares in the company fell later in the month as it released a full year trading update. The statement was in-line, highlighting 9% growth in its order book of contracted revenue to &pound;39.3m and a strong take up of its <em>StatPro Revolution</em> product. It appears investors are focusing on the ongoing challenge the company faces in migrating users of its legacy <em>Seven</em> products over to <em>Revolution</em>, which is likely to keep growth rates in check in the short term.</p>
        <p>Netcall (-5.5%) retraced a very strong December share price run, despite an update in January which confirmed the group traded in line with market expectations during the first half of its financial year to June 2017. The company said order inflow in the first half of its year was &ldquo;robust&rdquo; and annualised recurring revenues continued to grow, helped by an increasing proportion of software-as-a-service contracts among the new orders signed. It also retains &pound;14.6m of net cash on the balance sheet, representing over 15% of the market cap. </p>
        <p>Bond International Software exited the portfolio in January. The company delisted from AIM in December 2016, having agreed the sale of both its recruitment software subsidiaries (following a somewhat protracted bidding war) and, separately, its real estate assets. The disposal proceeds net of costs from its voluntary liquidation were returned to investors in January. </p>
        <p>The position in 7Digital was sold out of the Fund. In an update to the market in January, 7Digital detailed recent contract wins alongside 7.2% revenue growth over the year to December 2016 and the achievement of operating profitability in the final quarter of the year. However, with concerns remaining over continuing cash consumption and the company remaining sub-scale, the decision was taken to exit the holding, which had in any case become a &lsquo;de minimis&rsquo; position in recent years as the Fund grew in size but the stock&rsquo;s returns failed to keep pace.</p>

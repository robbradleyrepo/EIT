        <p><strong>For investment professionals only</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Fund returned 1.0%* in sterling terms in February, compared with the 2.0% return from the MSCI Europe ex-UK index.</strong></p>
        <p>After months of being dominated by political events and related news flow, global stock markets were influenced by more fundamental factors with a busy corporate results season and the release of macro data that included a strong UK Q4 GDP reading, higher-than-expected French and German PMI data and surprisingly strong Chinese trade data. This fundamental focus may be a short-lived trend as forthcoming elections in Germany, the Netherlands and France – as well as the resumption of Greek debt bailout talks – remain very much in investors’ thoughts. </p>
        <p>Political factors still played a part, albeit a smaller one, in driving equities higher with anticipation of Trump’s “phenomenal” tax reform measures a factor through February. Although his joint session of Congress speech at the end of the month subsequently failed to deliver the expected details, it was widely agreed that his tone was more ‘presidential’ than previous comments. A number of US and global equity indices finished the month at or near all-time highs, including the S&amp;P 500 and MSCI World.</p>
        <p>There was a reversal in the prevailing trend of cyclical outperformance versus defensives, with the financials sector (-1.6%) taking a breather after strong returns over the last six months, while consumer staples (+5.1%) recovered from its ‘bond proxy’ weakness. Other strong sectors included IT, up 5.6%, and health care, up 4.6%. Although Opec indicated that its cuts had reduced the oil market surplus quicker than it expected, the energy sector lagged the wider market’s rise, adding 0.7%. </p>
        <p>February proved to be a busy month for portfolio holdings both in terms of scheduled updates and more unexpected news flow. One of February’s top portfolio contributors was Oriflame, the Swedish consumer goods company. Its shares rose 37% following the publication of better-than-expected full year financial results, which showed evidence of strong growth in local currency sales, margin improvement, debt pay down and an extra dividend. </p>
        <p>Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever (+19.8%) was another stock in the spotlight in February as Kraft Heinz made a ‘friendly’ but unsolicited takeover for the company. The courtship lasted a matter of one weekend as Unilever firmly rebuffed the approach and Kraft Heinz baulked at the prospect of going hostile. Having jumped to reflect the near 20% premium of the bid, the shares managed to hold on to some of these gains as the deal floundered, with Unilever’s management stirred into action: announcing a strategic review and upgrading guidance towards the upper end of its prior forecast for 2017 of an improvement in core operating margin.</p>
        <p>Nordic construction and engineering group Peab (+17.2%) released 2016 results showing 5% growth in net sales to SEK46.5bn. The company made upbeat comments concerning its outlook, helped by growth in its order backlog following a 10% y-o-y increase in orders received to SEK41.4bn. Peab proposed a dividend per share of SEK3.8, up from SEK2.6. Danish shipping line operator DFDS (+14.2%) reported 27% growth in 2016 EBITDA to DKK2.6bn. The company saw freight volumes and passenger numbers increase by 21% and 12% respectively. DFDS announced a 33% increase in dividends to DKK8 per share, as well as two DKK800m share buybacks. In 2017, it expects 4% revenue growth and a further increase in EBITDA, with a guidance range of DKK2.6-2.8bn.</p>
        <p>Of the holdings to lose ground in February, Granges was the weakest, down 16.6%, although the fall looks to be nothing more significant than profit-taking following the release of 2016 results. Sales of the aluminium it produces for use in heat exchangers rose 12% and adjusted operating profit grew by 15%. Granges sees a positive outlook for 2017, particularly in Q1 when it expects above-trend light vehicle production globally.</p>
        <p>With the European financials sector giving up some recent gains in February, so too did shares in NN Group (-10.4%). NN Group’s Q4 operating result (from ongoing business) rose 12.6% y-o-y to €282m. Its full-year 2016 operating result declined due to the previously announced negative impact from storms on its non-life insurance business. </p>
        <p>Following the merger of Banco Popolare and Banca Popolare di Milano on 1 January 2017, the combined entity – Banco BPM (-10.8%) – released its first set of consolidated results. Evidence of a tough operating environment is clear through a net loss of €1.6bn. The company is responding by cutting back operating costs and attempting to de-risk its bad loan book.</p>
        <p>Nexans’ (-9.4%) shares softened on the back of results. It suffered a 1.2% organic decrease in sales volumes of its cables, primarily the result of weakness in the oil &amp; gas and mining sectors. It did, however, secure a higher operating margin. In 2017 it expects to register a further improvement in operating margin and return to sales growth. 2016 results from industrial conglomerate NKT showed a mixed performance as solid growth in its photonics and professional cleaning divisions was offset by a 10% fall in its cables revenues. The business is due to undergo significant change in 2017; in February it received EU Commission approval for the deal to acquire ABB’s high voltage cables business, which it plans to combine with its own cables division and spin-off into a separately listed company, and announced a new CEO for Nilfisk, the professional cleaning company which will form the other listed company.</p>

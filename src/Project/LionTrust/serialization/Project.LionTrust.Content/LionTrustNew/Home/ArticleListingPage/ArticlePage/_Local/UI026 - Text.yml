        <p>What does 2021 have in store for high yield investors? Based on the starting point for yields (4%) and our team&rsquo;s track record of decent stockpicking, even when dispersion in bond valuations is low, a 5% return for a sterling investor (4% for euros) is a realistic base case, in our opinion.</p>
        <p>Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember that the value of an investment and the income generated from them can fall as well as rise.</p>
        <p><strong>We also believe this 4-5% return outlook stacks up well versus other assets. Government bonds have never been more at risk of capital loss in a rising rates environment, just as the spectre of inflation is picking up. Meanwhile, equities are very capable of outperforming, but, as history tells us, not likely by that much as a collective, and would likely have double the drawdown, or worse, than high yield if risk markets hit a skiddy patch.</strong><br />
        <br />
        High yield bond interest payments are also non-negotiable, unlike equity dividends, making it a very dependable source of income. We continue to believe core, quality high yield has excellent risk/reward characteristics versus other potential homes for your hard-earned cash.<br />
        <br />
        Entering my twelfth calendar year as a manager of high yield bond funds, it is hard to gauge exactly how much of a good long-term track record is luck and how much is skill. Starting off in 2010 as I did, enormous support for credit markets has been in place throughout; we have been running with a tailwind for the entire race.<br />
        <br />
        Rarely has the &lsquo;central bankers have our back&rsquo; trade been more evident than in the second half of 2020. Despite fairly sizeable uncertainty, the weakest companies and bonds in our market rallied hard, with CCCs producing a return of over 18%, vastly outperforming BBs.<br />
        <br />
        Today, the difference in spread, the credit risk premium, between the average BB and CCC is around 5.5%, versus a ten-year average of around 7.5%. The lowest this has been in the last decade is a little over 4%. In other words, if we judge the high yield market by its weakest links, it is telling us the economic outlook is about as rosy as it gets.</p>

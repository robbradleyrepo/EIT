    <li>Our goal is to grow your capital and dividend payments regardless of economic and market conditions through a flexible investment process that is thoughtful and responsible.</li>
    <li>The Trust currently has a dividend yield of 4.2% and a dividend reserve of 1.2 years. The latter means we can maintain the dividend for just over a year without any of the companies we invest in making payments. </li>

        <p>‘Greenflation’ is a recently coined term that has gained currency in the last quarter to denote the surprisingly powerful and potentially persistent knock-on effect of ESG in its widest societal sense, and especially of one of its key tenets, the energy transition. Each of the ‘ESG’ constituents has the potential to be inflationary, at least in the short to medium term, in many cases due to temporal mismatches between the desire and ability to transition quickly. Examples of the S might include increased aggregate wage costs associated with closing the gender pay gap, increasing workplace diversity and ensuring fair pay and conditions for supply chains. Meanwhile, under G the costs associated with increased reporting and oversight have potentially inflationary consequences. Some of these additional costs will lead to an initial price adjustment, which may be inflationary in the short term but not over a longer period.</p>

        <h2>The price of the energy transition</h2>

        <p>High yield bond interest payments are also non-negotiable, unlike equity dividends, making it a very dependable source of income. We continue to believe core, quality high yield has excellent risk/reward characteristics versus other potential homes for your hard-earned cash. </p>
        
        <p>Entering my twelfth calendar year as a manager of high yield bond funds, it is hard to gauge exactly how much of a good long-term track record is luck and how much is skill. Starting off in 2010 as I did, enormous support for credit markets has been in place throughout; we have been running with a tailwind for the entire race.</p> 
        
        <p>Rarely has the ‘central bankers have our back’ trade been more evident than in the second half of 2020. Despite fairly sizeable uncertainty, the weakest companies and bonds in our market rallied hard, with CCCs producing a return of over 18%, vastly outperforming BBs.</p> 
        
        <p>Today, the difference in spread, the credit risk premium, between the average BB and CCC is around 5.5%, versus a ten-year average of around 7.5%. The lowest this has been in the last decade is a little over 4%. In other words, if we judge the high yield market by its weakest links, it is telling us the economic outlook is about as rosy as it gets.</p>
        
        <h2>Technology’s deflationary role</h2>
        <p>
        There is little doubt that advances in technology that improve productivity and operational efficiency are deflationary. One of the exciting aspects of the energy transition is the fact it can and has the potential to bring down the lifecycle, also known as the ‘levelised’, cost of energy. Indeed, costs of wind and solar power fell rapidly and became cost-competitive with fossil fuel technologies in the early 2010s. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Some technologies are easier to implement than others - larger wind turbines are low-hanging fruit, for example. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been much harder to implement, in part due to expense, as well as general logistics - it is an inflationary technology that reduces the cost competitiveness of fossil fuels. Mini-nuclear reactors have great potential to bring rapid change to the energy mix at a relatively lower cost than larger nuclear plants.
        </p>
        <p>
        Wind, solar, tidal, hydro, geothermal and traditional nuclear power, along with new technologies such as green hydrogen (if achievable at a competitive cost) and bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS), as well as innovations that improve energy efficiency, are likely to remain the dominant growth areas as the world seeks to decarbonise to reach 2050 goals. But in the very short term, they will offer little relief to higher fuel prices that are challenging some businesses and households, especially against a backdrop of a strong impulse to quickly cut reliance on fossil fuels. 
        </p>
        <p>        
        This dynamic is creating opportunities for companies providing best-in-class technology and processes for improving energy efficiency and network efficacy. Genuit, Weir and Centrica, which are held in the Trust, are all extremely well positioned to benefit over the medium to long term from the energy transition and sustainable trends.</p>

        <h2>It’s inflation Jim, but not as we know it</h2>

        <p>Few believe there will be a return to the hyperinflation of the 1970s, but it is possible that levels will remain above the 2% target rates of the Bank of England and the US Fed for a considerable time to come. There are, of course, short, medium and longer-term pressures on both sides of the supply and demand complex. An easing of supply chain bottlenecks, which should occur within the next 12 to 18 months (if not sooner) will alleviate some inflationary pressures, and the rebasing of inflation data will flatter the headline numbers later this year, although CPI rates are likely to rise further in the short-term. AI in supply chains, autonomous vehicles, robotics in healthcare, will mean technology will continue to be a formidable deflationary force. However, the energy transition and the widespread shift to stakeholder capitalism could continue to have inflationary consequences in the medium term. However, climate change itself is inflationary and is already presenting cost pressures in terms of addressing food and water security, shoring up infrastructure and managing the risk to human health. While greenflation may be a short-term challenge for policymakers and society; the alternative of not dealing with the climate emergency could be much worse.</p>

        <h2>Key Risks</h2>

        <p class="bold">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. The value of an investment and the income generated from it can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed. You may get back less than you originally invested. The issue of units/shares in Liontrust Funds may be subject to an initial charge, which will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term. Investments should always be considered as long term. </p>

        <p>Investment in funds managed by the Global Fundamental Team may involve investment in smaller companies. These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. Some of the funds may hold a concentrated portfolio of stocks, meaning that if the price of one of these stocks should move significantly, this may have a notable effect on the value of that portfolio. Investment in the funds may involve foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. Some of the funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</p>

        <p>‘Greenflation’ is a recently coined term that has gained currency in the last quarter to denote the surprisingly powerful and potentially persistent knock-on effect of ESG in its widest societal sense, and especially of one of its key tenets, the energy transition.  </p>

        <h2>The price of the energy transition</h2>

        <p>High yield bond interest payments are also non-negotiable, unlike equity dividends, making it a very dependable source of income. We continue to believe core, quality high yield has excellent risk/reward characteristics versus other potential homes for your hard-earned cash. </p>
        
        <ul>
                <li>Our goal is to grow your capital and dividend payments regardless of economic and market conditions through a flexible investment process that is thoughtful and responsible.</li>
                <li>The Trust currently has a dividend yield of 4.2% and a dividend reserve of 1.2 years. The latter means we can maintain the dividend for just over a year without any of the companies we invest in making payments. </li> 
        </ul> 

        <p>Entering my twelfth calendar year as a manager of high yield bond funds, it is hard to gauge exactly how much of a good long-term track record is luck and how much is skill. Starting off in 2010 as I did, enormous support for credit markets has been in place throughout; we have been running with a tailwind for the entire race.</p> 
        
        <blockquote class="e-blockquote-brand">This means if things are not quite as rosy as valuations suggest, we will do a good job in defending our client’s capital. We think high yield should still be on your radar.</blockquote>
 
        <h2>Key Risks</h2>

        <p class="bold">Past performance is not a guide to future performance. The value of an investment and the income generated from it can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed. You may get back less than you originally invested. The issue of units/shares in Liontrust Funds may be subject to an initial charge, which will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term. Investments should always be considered as long term. </p>

        <p>Investment in funds managed by the Global Fundamental Team may involve investment in smaller companies. These stocks may be less liquid and the price swings greater than those in, for example, larger companies. Some of the funds may hold a concentrated portfolio of stocks, meaning that if the price of one of these stocks should move significantly, this may have a notable effect on the value of that portfolio. Investment in the funds may involve foreign currencies and may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates. Some of the funds may invest in emerging markets/soft currencies and in financial derivative instruments, both of which may have the effect of increasing volatility.</p>

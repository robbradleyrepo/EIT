            What does 2021 have in store for high yield investors? Based on the
            starting point for yields (4%) and our team’s track record of decent
            stockpicking, even when dispersion in bond valuations is low, a 5%
            return for a sterling investor (4% for euros) is a realistic base
            case, in our opinion.

            We also believe this 4-5% return outlook stacks up well versus other
            assets. Government bonds have never been more at risk of capital
            loss in a rising rates environment, just as the spectre of inflation
            is picking up. Meanwhile, equities are very capable of
            outperforming, but, as history tells us, not likely by that much as
            a collective, and would likely have double the drawdown, or worse,
            than high yield if risk markets hit a skiddy patch.
          </p>
          <p>
            High yield bond interest payments are also non-negotiable, unlike
            equity dividends, making it a very dependable source of income. We
            continue to believe core, quality high yield has excellent
            risk/reward characteristics versus other potential homes for your
            hard-earned cash.
          </p>
          <p>
            Entering my twelfth calendar year as a manager of high yield bond
            funds, it is hard to gauge exactly how much of a good long-term
            track record is luck and how much is skill. Starting off in 2010 as
            I did, enormous support for credit markets has been in place
            throughout; we have been running with a tailwind for the entire
            race.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rarely has the ‘central bankers have our back’ trade been more
            evident than in the second half of 2020. Despite fairly sizeable
            uncertainty, the weakest companies and bonds in our market rallied
            hard, with CCCs producing a return of over 18%, vastly outperforming
            BBs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the difference in spread, the credit risk premium, between
            the average BB and CCC is around 5.5%, versus a ten-year average of
            around 7.5%. The lowest this has been in the last decade is a little
            over 4%. In other words, if we judge the high yield market by its
            weakest links, it is telling us the economic outlook is about as
            rosy as it gets.

            I believe in our investment process, even though we could have made
            a little more for our clients if we had reached down the quality
            spectrum, backing to a greater extent the measures in place to
            support credit markets. But then, what is it we are trying to
            achieve for our clients? My view of this is that we are trying to
            provide a good source of income and returns, in good times and bad,
            for the long-term. In this regard, I believe our process would have
            achieved this goal even if central bankers had not been standing
            behind us with a wind generator.

            As is typical of our Liontrust GF High Yield Bond Fund, going into
            2021, we are light in CCCs and avoiding accumulations of thematic,
            commodity-like cyclicals. We are sanguine on the default risk within
            our Fund relative to a market that is being well supported by
            monetary institutions.

            This means if things are not quite as rosy as valuations suggest, we
            will do a good job in defending our client’s capital. We think high
            yield should still be on your radar.

          <p>
            Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Do remember
            that the value of an investment and the income generated from them
            can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore, you may
            not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk
            total loss of capital. The majority of the Liontrust Sustainable
            Future Funds have holdings which are denominated in currencies other
            than Sterling and may be affected by movements in exchange rates.
            Some of these funds invest in emerging markets which may involve a
            higher element of risk due to less well-regulated markets and
            political and economic instability. Consequently the value of an
            investment may rise or fall in line with the exchange rates.
            Liontrust UK Ethical Fund, Liontrust SF European Growth Fund and
            Liontrust SF UK Growth Fund invest geographically in a narrow range
            and has a concentrated portfolio of securities, there is an
            increased risk of volatility which may result in frequent rises and
            falls in the Fund’s share price. Liontrust SF Managed Fund,
            Liontrust SF Corporate Bond Fund, Liontrust SF Cautious Managed
            Fund, Liontrust SF Defensive Managed Fund and Liontrust Monthly
            Income Bond Fund invest in bonds and other fixed-interest securities
            - fluctuations in interest rates are likely to affect the value of
            these financial instruments. If long-term interest rates rise, the
            value of your shares is likely to fall. If you need to access your
            money quickly it is possible that, in difficult market conditions,
            it could be hard to sell holdings in corporate bond funds. This is
            because there is low trading activity in the markets for many of the
            bonds held by these funds. Mentioned above five funds can also
            invest in derivatives. Derivatives are used to protect against
            currencies, credit and interests rates move or for investment
            purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative
            positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on
            transactions.
